Travellers. The sarangi player
The Sârangi is one of the oldest and most important classical bowed string instrument of India's Hindustani classical music, also present in Pakistan and Nepal.

The word sarangi is derived from two Hindi words: sau (meaning &quot;twenty&quot;) and rang (meaning &quot;colour&quot;). This is because the sound of the sarangi is said to be as expressive and evocative as twenty colours. 
The repertoire of sarangi players is traditionally very closely related to vocal music, although it can also be used as a main instrument in râgâs (Indian classical music pieces). Amongst the great masters of sârangi we find  Pandit Ram Narayan, Ustad Sabri Khan and Ustad Sultan Khan.

Here, a capture of my friend Ioannis in full concentration, taken in Madhya-Pradesh (Central India), a couple of years ago. Ioannis has been practicing the sârangi and the sitar for several years, and unsurprisingly, he and i met in India and discoverd we shared the same interest and love for both North India's Hindustani and South India's Carnatic music traditions.
