African Wild Dogs
South Luangwa NP, Zambia
Photographing African Wild Dogs is always a bit of a challenge. Besides the greatest challenge of finding them, it´s tricky to get contrast in their face because it´s mostly totally black. You have to find a compromise as you don´t want to burn out the bright parts.
