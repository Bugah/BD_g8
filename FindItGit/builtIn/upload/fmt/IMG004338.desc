Audio: By Cam
A pair of sick headphones to compliment my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cam-m/6918364853/in/photostream">Lego iPod</a>. They're pretty stable but if you put them on your head and start dancing to dubstep, they'll fall and break. 
(I know they don't have a wire, let's just say that their wireless.)
