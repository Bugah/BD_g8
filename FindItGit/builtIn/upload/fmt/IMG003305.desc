bearded iris Ã  la Georgia O'Keeffe
To quote Georgia O'Keeffe, &quot;Nobody sees a flower really; it is so small. We haven't time, and to see takes time - like to have a friend takes time.&quot; 

Iris macro from my gardens. Straight out of the camera... no post processing. It appears to have two eyes and it's looking right at you. LOL I thought about making this into a Halloween or a masquerade mask :)

Many thanks to everyone for the views, comments, faves, and invitations.
