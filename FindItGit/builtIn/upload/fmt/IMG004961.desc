Osprey taking off with trout - reflection
One more image taken from Gordon Macleods excellent hide in the centre of Aviemore.  The osprey's have now left for their long migration back to Africa.  They have been very addictive to photograph and I have enjoyed every minute watching these fascinating birds fish, can't wait for them to come back next March!
