Flowers and Carved Stone
I kept driving and driving and driving and weaved my way up past a town in the far northwest fjords.  I saw this strangely (and nicely) shaped mountain with that strange early-morning lighting.  Then, I spent another hour or so hiking around until I found this special kind of blue flower (<strong>EDIT</strong> thanks to commenters Scott &amp; Guðjón -  it is called the lupine or lúpína in Icelandic).  Just when I was about to give up, I found a giant patch of them, so I selected the right lens and set up for this shot.
