its a bit late to be uploading this (thats film for you but have been on the ball with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lomokev/2210102863/">the wood!</a>). this is the queue out side bramptons butchers, these people are waiting to pick up there christmas turkeys on the day before christmas eve. the fools! i picked mine up the day before when there was no queue. i can not recommend bramptons butchers enough the meat is the best and thoroughly dead. on the subject of meat i would like to welcome <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fraying/">fraying</a> back to the carnivore club after eating his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fraying/2208206828/">first meat in 20 years!</a> (i am surprised he is still alive!), that brought a tier to my eye when i read that i can tell you.

and the green grocers across the street is grate to but they don't sell meat, alices coffee shop is also worth a visit but they do not sell meat either
