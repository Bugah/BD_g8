My Comfort
No classes on Tuesdays! :) so Ryan took me out for Thai food in Corona del Mar. Afterward, we had a nice photoshoot near the beach. The weather has drastically changed from super hot to winter cold. This is probably the last time I'll be at the beach until next summer T_T

To process this picture, I used <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rebecca-lily/">Rebecca Lily's</a> preset (vintage wash) with a few minor tweaks. Thank you Rebecca for this wonderful gift &hearts;

I also need to give a big thanks to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/1ragincajun/">Brian </a> for his very sweet testimonial &hearts; He's been such a great friend and I was very touched by his words.
