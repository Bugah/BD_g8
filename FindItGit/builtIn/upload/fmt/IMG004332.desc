Out of Key
Oh, what a find! I made my driver, Andrew, stop and let me take pictures of this old abandoned gas station, just out of Chickamauga, GA and there were a few cool standard old gas station shots to take, but then we found a couple of really nifty old pianos that had literally been left out  exposed to the weather for who knows how long. I was like a kid on Christmas day. I had to hold myself back and only take a few pictures, so I'd still have 'film' left for the rest of the day.
