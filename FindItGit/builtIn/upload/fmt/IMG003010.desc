My Desk (ND Filters)
Okay so this is really my first proper test using ND Filters. Used two on my lens an ND2 &amp; an ND8 Mounted on my Nikkor 18-105 kit lens

fairly pleased for a first attempt. To say this was indoors as well. Im Hoping to get better when I do more outdoors photography.

Merry Christmas :D
