I have seen shots like this before and always wanted to give it a try. This was in Penn Station I came across the escalator and had a couple minutes to kill. I took it for a ride up and down and snapped a couple. Probably could have got a better shot but I had something to work with. It took me a long time to try and fix the imperfection in PS, tell me what you think?
