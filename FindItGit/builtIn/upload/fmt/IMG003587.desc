Burned With Desire
“Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall...”
~Chaka Khan

This shot was taken in last year’s Macau Fireworks Festival. With my friends from Shenzhen, <a href="#//www.flickr.com/photos/millanprible/" rel="nofollow">millan</a> and <a href="#//www.flickr.com/photos/ninarichel/" rel="nofollow">richelle</a>. Unfortunately they can’t access <a href="http://flickr.com" rel="nofollow">flickr</a> (I believe ‘till this very moment) because it was banned in China for unknown reasons. if ever you're aware with this topic, just let me know. Cheers!
