<i>I think this tiny leaf serration is amazing.  I spent so long trying to focus on it that I almost couldn't see when I stood up!

I have been noticing tinier and tinier details lately.  I wish I could get even closer to them.  There is something that draws me to the earth and to plants.  What draws you to nature?</i>
