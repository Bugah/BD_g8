Report 3-6810-4

Received two new subjects for the ongoing H.E.X. experiment today. Initial test results show them holding great potential. I'm very thrilled. Maybe they'll even last long enough to meet The Mexican.
Subject are to be labeled Mr Wong and Punk Suit. Assignment to H.E.X. module 4 is scheduled for next Tuesday. Proceed with full medical diagnostics immediately.
