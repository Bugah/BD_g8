Soul in a Rose
I sat in my desolation
Withdrawn from all around,
Feeling my life was a ruin, a failure.
I was empty inside with the utter collapse of my being.
I did not care anymore for living or dying.
I was alone in my distress and desolation.
But as I sat sadly on the ground,
The sun reached out his hand to me and touched my face. And so my healing began.
