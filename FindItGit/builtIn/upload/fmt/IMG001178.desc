Marymoor wave
Like some of you suggested on that previous similar shot, it really looked like a huge wave rolling in. hence the title. it was actually very magical, so you haven't seen everything yet from this awesome morning, that's a sure fact.
as a matter of fact, fog was also there this morning, so i just couldn't help it and went back to marymoor for a few additional shots. 

i'll be heading to Cannon Beach at the end of the day. will be back on sunday night.
a great weekend to all of you!
