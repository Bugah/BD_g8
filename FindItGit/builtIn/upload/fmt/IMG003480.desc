Puddle Reflections Along East Lake Shore Drive
took a brief walk around East Lake Shore Drive yesterday morning right around the Drake Hotel area... the hotel is actually to my right side when i took this shot and the buildings in the frame i think are residential buildings...and over to my left would be Lake Shore Drive...i wish i had more time yesterday to go around and shoot some more especially with that 60 degree temperature that felt like a heat wave...hope everyone's well...pls. <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=6804498945&amp;size=large" rel="nofollow">View On Black</a>
