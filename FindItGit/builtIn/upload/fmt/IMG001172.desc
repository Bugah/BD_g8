while in paris, we stayed at a little apartment that belongs to my friend, flora -- she was out of town, so she sweetly offered to let us stay.  the apartment was just below <i>montmartre</i>, towards <i>le moulin rouge</i>... a wonderful area with all kinds of little daily shops -- flowers, bakeries, greengrocers, etc. -- and not very touristy.

the first morning there, we decided to get up very early and climb up towards <i>sacré-cœur</i>, to get an overview of the city at first light.  i thought i'd wait till the sun lay its golden rays on the church for a nice HDR.  after taking the usual symmetrical shots one sees anywhere, i felt that the dark, textured cobblestone was important to the feel of the place, and tried to get a shot to include both church and street.

mr.G's feedback was crucial to this shot, and he expects to receive 20% of its value.  i disagreed, but only because i secretly think he should get much more.
