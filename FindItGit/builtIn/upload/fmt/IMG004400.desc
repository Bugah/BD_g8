The power of H2O
I took this shot from the Argentine side of the Foz Iguacu waterfalls. The Argentine side has the most action and excitement and you’ll need an entire day to explore all the sites. It had rained a lot the few weeks before I arrived and I was lucky that the sun was shining. According to the locals there was 10 times the amount of water rolling down the waterfalls as normal, this was great but it also meant that there was a lot of spray as well.

Ps. I’ve had a really busy day yesterday, one of my crystal balls was on the Flickr blog. This meant that I had about 10.000 views, 100 comments and 300 faves in one day so I’m sorry if I didn’t get back to you but I’ll try to make it up.
