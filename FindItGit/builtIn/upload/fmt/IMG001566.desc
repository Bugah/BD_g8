Cat Cage (Explored)
This is an abandoned zoo in Los angeles.  This room once housed some big cats.  I don't know what kind of cats so I'll assume they were lions, no, they were sabertooth tigers with gift card to a paint store.  
This room is triangle shaped, it's about 6' x 6' x 6'
I was finally able to meet dacoach89_89 on this day.  Great guy and one hell of a photographer.
