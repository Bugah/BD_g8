Moscow Metro - Take 6: Kievskaya
This was the first station I visited. Kievskaya on the Moscow Metro. Planned to be the second, but unfortunately the one I had planned for 1st was shut down due to a bombing a couple of years back... I was there two weeks after the bombing in the Moscow airport, so I figured it was probably a good call that the station was closed. When I got here I realized that getting shots without people was going to be tough so my best bet was waiting for at least my immediate foreground to open up. Anyway, not my favorite station, but another amazing one you just don't expect to see in a place like Moscow when you don't know anything about the city...
