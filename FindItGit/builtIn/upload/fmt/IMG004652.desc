I finally got myself a cell phone from the modern era. Ha.   I'm really lovin' it so far - very very fun.  

The <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2649/3697100829_603b13f468_b.jpg" rel="nofollow">camera</a> is cool too (i actually have to remind myself that it is a phone and not just a camera/computer. ha. really). 

Here are a few snapshots.  Most are sooc, but a few are processed with the &quot;camera bag&quot; app.
