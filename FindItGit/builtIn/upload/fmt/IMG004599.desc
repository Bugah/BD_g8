Your flames are spreading.
Your rays are reaching the sky.

Hey guys. My eyeballs are about to fall out of my head from editing 495209849208904729054892845 photos. Not really. But I am behind by three weddings and two lifestyle sessions and I just shot a mini (best way to describe it?) wedding today. I hope to be all caught up by next week. In the mean time, you can check out what I've been up to (including some NYC shots) <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Luray-VA/RTArmstrong-Photography/60633823180" rel="nofollow">here</a> -- but only if you really want to. ;)
