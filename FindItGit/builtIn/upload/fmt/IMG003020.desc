First Lights
Winner of the &quot;best of the best&quot; for Aviation Week and Space Technology's 2011 photo contest! 

The first northern lights I've been able to photograph for the season.  They've been out for a month or so, but when you're flying every day it's hard to get out and shoot them.  So, I was pretty happy to be able to combine the flying and lights!
