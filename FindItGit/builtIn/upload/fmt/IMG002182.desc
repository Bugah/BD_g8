lost childhood
<i>&quot;Grown-ups love figures.  When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters.  They never say to you, &quot;What does his voice sound like?  What games does he love best?  Does he collect butterflies?&quot; Instead, they demand:  &quot;How old is he?  How many brothers has he?  How much does he weigh?  How much money does his father make?&quot;  Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.&quot;  
~Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, The Little Prince, 1943, translated from French</i>

This little toy is more than fifty years old. It belongs to my mother and it was her companion when she was a child. She took him everywhere she had to go, he protected her in good and in bad times. So this little guy is filled with lots of memories, with laughter and tears. Today he has a honorable place beside her favourite books and she protects him :)
