Snuggle
Baby pigs sleeping. 

<b>A different perspective</b>: I went to the Utah State Fair yesterday. When you're at a fair, you've got to go see the baby animals, right? The photo below is the perspective that everyone saw from the front of the pen. By going all the way around the exhibit and behind the pen, I was able to take this aerial view. Changing perspectives can make all the difference. (Unless you know this is a &quot;from above view&quot;, they almost looked stacked on top of each other, don't they?)

Note: a full-frame, uncropped, horizontal version is available of this image. (The mother pig is just to the right, outside of the picture frame.)
