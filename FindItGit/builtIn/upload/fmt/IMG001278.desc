Fortaleza Skyline Time Lapse (Sunset and Sunrise)
This is my first time lapse. I've used a Canon XS (1000D) to shoot it, 0.04 seconds each frame during 3 hours (sunrise) and 1:30 hour (sunset). The time lapse was taken from my room's window... gotta love boredom :)
This is located at Fortaleza, CE, Brazil, around Varjota, Aldeota, Meireles and Beira Mar. Enjoy it!
