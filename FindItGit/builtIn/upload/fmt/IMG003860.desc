Golfball in the Lake
The University of Surrey &quot;Golf-Ball&quot; shortly after installation taking a little trip into the lake (allegedly with assistance).

For those of you who don't know the Surrey Campus, the Golf-Ball is a metal sculpture that usually resides on the slope between the lake and the main car park. Now it's firmly bolted (and welded) down, but still gets used as a climbing frame by inebriated students from time to time.

This photo wasn't actually taken by me, but I scanned it in from an old set of photos using an HP Scanjet 3300C.
