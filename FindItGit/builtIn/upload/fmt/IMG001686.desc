Princess at 6 Feet & 220mm
And still another shot (NO you still have not seen them all) of the princess as she lay on top of Rover. If you look close you can see a criter on the side of her facs and the spots on her coat reflected in her eye. A memory I'll NEVER forget. Strong side lighting in the early morning sun. FYI: This is just the way the picture was taken and is NOT a crop.
