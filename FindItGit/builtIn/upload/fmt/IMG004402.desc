Luke LaLonde
chicago, il // Luke Lalonde from the Born Ruffians @ Lincoln Hall 

- I got to see Born Ruffians on Wednesday in Chicago. They were my most listened to band in 2008 and their in my top 5 favorite bands. It was awesome finally seeing them live. The place got a little more crowded than i expected it to be seeing as i've never met another Born Ruffians Fan before. Either way i was an experience. I was lucky enough to be able to bring my camera with me. I was right up front and got good positioning for the lead singer Luke Lalonde, but unfortunately, there was a huge symbol in my way for the drummer Steve, Mitch was at an odd angle, and the new guy was too far away. all-in-all though, i got off a few good shots.
