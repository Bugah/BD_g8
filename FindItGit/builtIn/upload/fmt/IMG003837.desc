<i>Italia a Zandvoort</i>

A beautiful Lamborghini Gallardo SE, surrounded by Maserati's.

From the roof of the paddock you looked right down on the stand of cardealer Hessing. These great cars where parked on a bright surface so with a little editing, I merged five different shots into this creation.

The fact that the point of view differs per car is due to the fact that the cars where parked at different distances.
