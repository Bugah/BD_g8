3-D Farm Animal Cookies
These cookies were designed for one of my youngest grand daughters (2-1/2 years old). The same one that wanted the striped cat cookies. This time she asked for cookie animals that will stand up by &quot;she self&quot;. These are completely edible as there is a pretzel stick running though the loose middle cookies. Hand cut cookies with royal icing. The heads are attached with RI to the leg fronts. The pretzel stick is attached with RI to a hole in the back legs. The middles are just set over the pretzel and left loose. A cookie or lollipop stick can be used for more stability.
