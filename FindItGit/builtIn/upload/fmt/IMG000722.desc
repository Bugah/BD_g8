Go with the flooooooooow
Here is a shot of Crush from the Finding Nemo muscial at Animal Kingdom.  I've seen a lot of great shots of this on Flickr so I was happy to finally be able to see this in person.  Awesome show.  What made it even better was the fact we sat next to this performer's parents during the show.  His Mom knew all of the words and she was quietly singing along the whole time.  A very proud Mom indeed.  Thanks for looking!

Heading to EPCOT tomorrow.  Going to try to meet up with the Flickr group for the WDW 40th, for one of the days they are in town in a few days.
