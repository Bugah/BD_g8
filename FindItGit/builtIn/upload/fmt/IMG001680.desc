The Sphinx
This is part of a work in progress, it will be an illustration and a watermark for a book.  It was alot of fun combining stocks to make the sphinx.  Thanks to Lockstock at deviantART for the beautiful model photography <a href="http://lockstock.deviantart.com/">lockstock.deviantart.com/</a>
