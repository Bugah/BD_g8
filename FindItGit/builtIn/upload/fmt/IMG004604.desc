Our Worlds
This is from the first roll of film through my new (to me, of course) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marknye/7430583072/in/photostream">Olympus XA</a>. It was shot on Arista 400 b&amp;w film, stand developed in 1:100 Rodinal for an hour, then scanned using a CanoScan 8400F.

I've shot plenty of film in my lifetime, but coming back to it after several years of working in digital, it feels like something completely new. I decide to give film a second spin because I was interested in stand development, which <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49065107@N06/">Tricia V.</a> turned me on to. In short, instead of mixing the regular strong developer solution and timing your development carefully, you mix a very weak solution (typically 1:100) and let the film sit in the developer for an hour or more. Development stops when the solution is spent, and timing isn't particularly important. Furthermore, development time is exactly the same regardless of the speed of the film, and whether or not you're pushing or pulling.

This is my first real stand developed roll, and I'm still dealing with a few unknowns. This roll came out a bit grainier than I expected. I'm not sure if it's a result of the film choice, the stand development process, or my chemical temperature, which was a bit warm.

Wondering about the title? First, I spend plenty of time in public with my own smartphone. Second, check out the reflections.
