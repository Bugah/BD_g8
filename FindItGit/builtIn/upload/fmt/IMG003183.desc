My rose for all...
This is my favourite rose which bloomed now and I dedicate it to all the Mothers (here  we had it last week) and to all my friends and contacts .. to all of you! Its lovely unique color and scents makes me happy. Wishing all a nice day! And to my Mother too, an artist whom introduced me to good things in life .. like jazz ...and roses!
