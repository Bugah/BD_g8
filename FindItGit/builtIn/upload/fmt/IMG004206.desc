Made in Scotland
Royal Mile, Edinburgh

I took this photograph, which represents the traditional aspects of Great Britain, in one of the oldest parts of Edinburgh.
 At a time when the mobile phone is ubiquitous, the old red telephone box takes us back in time. The boy on the left is dressed in the traditional British school uniform. The whole image is framed by the old-fashioned buildings of the Royal Mile. 
The only detail which reminds us it’s the present day is the poster at the top of the telephone box which tells us we’re in a WiFi zone.
