Flying in France
I remember when I was learning French at Jesuit.  I took four years of it, and one of the first things I saw was a little cartoon in a book.  It was two little French girls on a ride just like this.  One was saying to the other, &quot;Aiiyeeeee!  Sylvie!  Tenez!!!!&quot;

Anyway, I always think of that when I see little French children on a ride.  I feel like calling it out, but it always seems a little creepy for a stranger to say such a thing.
