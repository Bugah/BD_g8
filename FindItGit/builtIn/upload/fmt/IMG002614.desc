Crochet Curtain
Now on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/babukatorium/135999423156305?sk=wall" rel="nofollow">facebook</a> too!!! XD

Here are the new pictures from Bielsko-Biała (Poland). There were the &quot;Hungarian days&quot; between crochet installations, my exhibition of crochet clothes, (not only) Hungarian painter's pictures exhibition via Art Stúdió Galéria ( <a href="http://www.agaleria.hu/" rel="nofollow">www.agaleria.hu/</a> ), different types of music from M.C.S Blues Band ( <a href="http://www.mcsbluesband.com/" rel="nofollow">www.mcsbluesband.com/</a> ), Plum Is Fallin' ( <a href="http://www.myspace.com/plumisfallin" rel="nofollow">www.myspace.com/plumisfallin</a> ), Lajos (who is a great &quot;street-singer&quot; and played Hungarian pop/rock songs and some well known american hits) and two incredible Italian/Austrian djs... And many more! I still need to collect all of the links to show! @;)
The crochet curtain is in the garden of Vagina Cafe ( <a href="http://www.vaginacafe.pl/" rel="nofollow">www.vaginacafe.pl/</a> ) in the city center of Bielsko-Biała. I'm not sure if I can call it curtain if it's outside from the window... @;) Please correct me if You know a better word for it! 
Made of 36 different coloured spiderwebs (still in rainbow order), recycled from the Rainbow Tree like the light pole's &quot;dress&quot; (http://www.flickr.com/photos/babukatorium/5881174838/in/photostream). I just washed (my Mom washed - AHAH!) the old project's spiderwebs and added a black border for commemorate the Tree. RIP. 
And YESSS, I had to climb here too!!! XD All the stuff of Vagina Cafe, M.C.S Blues Band and the owner's friends were helping me during the installation with their kind words (like talking to my knees to stop trembling and to my brain: you will have your favourite beer after you finished!!!)... XD
Good news: I've done the work, I had my beer and I promised to myself that I won't ever (I mean NEVER EVER) climb again so high without protections! (maybe for some other Desperados I should change idea... I really LOVE that beer!!!) LOL
