The image of Canadian soldier Patrick Cloutier and Saskatchewan Native Brad Laroque is arguably one of the most famous Canadian photographs taken in the last half century.  It depicts a stand off that occurred during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oka_Crisis" rel="nofollow"> Oka Crisis </a> which commenced on July 11, 1990.

The original image was taken by Shaney Komulainen of the Canadian Press and our Trooper and the Fetts hope they have done his photograph justice.

Enjoy!
