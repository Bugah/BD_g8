Swiftsure Racing
The annual Swiftsure Sailing Race is a wonderful event in Victoria.  While the winds were light, we did have a lovely group of boats sailing past Dallas Road to get in position for the race.

While I am not happy with the sharpness of this shot, I love the scene with the single boat and the lovely Olympic Mountains in the background.
