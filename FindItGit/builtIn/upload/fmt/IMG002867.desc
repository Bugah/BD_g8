CT-22 Lammegrier- Armored Transport Dropship
A further evolution of my detatchable dropship-barge project.  I totally rebuilt the gunship on top of the barge, turned around 180 degrees so the bay opens to the rear of the ship.  She got much shorter and much wider, and finally got some stout looking engines.  I believe I'm finally ready to build an APC.
