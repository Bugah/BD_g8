The Keeper of Bees
Honey! The joyful beekeeper of the Faerie Forest. He is the tamer of bears and harvester of honey. He does all he can to make the lives of the forestmen on the Mystic Isles just a little bit sweeter. :)

Be careful though, in war he can be a terror. Catapulting hives during sieges and charging with bears into combat!

The Faerie Forest is nearing it's completion stay tuned! :D

P.S. I've actually been learning to be a bee keeper for more than a year now, and we bought our first personal hive more than a week ago :) Yay us. Swing by some time for some honey!
