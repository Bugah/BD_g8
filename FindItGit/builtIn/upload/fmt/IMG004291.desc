The Haunted Piano
I've played the violin since I was five, but the piano is probably my favorite instrument to play.  I visited my parents this weekend and one of the things I miss most from my parents' house is the piano.  I always make it a point to spend some quality time playing it when I go home.  Here, I was playing around with lightpainting - these are my mother's hands:)
