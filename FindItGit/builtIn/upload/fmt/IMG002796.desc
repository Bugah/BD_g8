Why wait 'till August?
Looking at the Space Police sets, I realized I have all the parts I need for that spiked car, at least for what I would turn it into. After that, I just had to have a go at the police ship. They now each sit two. 
Not your typical Peaceful Lego MOC, but it's worth noting that both crafts are unarmed. Those are all maneuvering thrusters. The only &quot;weapon&quot; the police cruiser has is FEMPP (focussed-electro-magnetic-pulse-projector), that can disable the systems on pursued craft, stopping it effectively.
