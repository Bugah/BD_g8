Dance [ of the ] Masai
The Maasai are an indigenous African ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. Due to their distinctive customs and dress and residence near the many game parks of East Africa, they are among the most well-known African ethnic groups internationally. The Maasai maintain many of their cultural traditions while engaging contemporary regional and global economic, social, and political forces.

I've been up to a few things which I will share with all of you soon, but perhaps I could leak a small piece of news right now. Like some of you might know, my set of Cokin filters is my best friend and is plays a very essential part in most of my landscapes and nature captures. I've been contacted by my favorite photographic-filter manufacturer &quot;Cokin&quot; a couple of months back. To keep the story short, you can find some of my work featured right now on the .Experiences section on the Cokin website.
