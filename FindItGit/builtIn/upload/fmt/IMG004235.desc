Volcan Ollaque
This beautiful and even a bit active volcano lies at the border between Chile and Bolivia, although the actual top is situated in Chili at 5858m. 

Volcán Ollagüe, also known as Oyahué, is a massive andesitic stratovolcano with a summit dacitic lava dome
Active sulfur mines on the upper western and southern flanks are reached by a road that climbs to about 5500 m elevation. No historical eruptions have been recorded from Ollagüe; activity has been restricted to periods of intense fumarolic activity, and a persistent steam plume emanates from a fumarole on the south side of the summit dome.
