falowa
Imagine a small archipelago of 10 islands, only 3 of which are inhabited (Batan, Sabtang and Itbayat). Although the territorial seas of Batanes are so wide, the currents and winds are so treacherous and powerful that the Ivatans can practically only perform fishing 3 months of the year, during summer in March to May. 

The design of the traditional boats of Batanes date back to pre-Hispanic period. Unlike the common Southeast Asian outriggered banca with a V cross-section, the Batanes <i>falowa</i>- the smaller ones are sometimes referred to as <i>sarao</i>- has rounded sides and flat stern that skims the stormy Batanes sea.
