All grown up
This lion photo, taken at Dublin Zoo, is from our Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Collection. It was printed in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Saturday, 3 September 1932, under the caption <b>No longer a &quot;cub&quot;</b>, and continues:  &quot;This was one of the cubs exhibited at the <i>Irish Independent</i> Stand at the Dublin Horse Show in 1928 - now one of the great attractions at the Zoological Gardens in Dublin.&quot;

The mind boggles at lion cubs being used on a Stand at the Horse Show!

Date: 1932
