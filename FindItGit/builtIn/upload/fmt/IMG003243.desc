vintage unknown girl in a hat
I really love this vintage girl with her hat being pulled down. And the weird shadow invading on the left. Pretty girl and mysterious, since there's nothing written on the back about who it is or when or where.

One of many various photos found after my grandmother's death in November. They were all in a taped up box in her closet.
