Taken By Danielle

I sent my daughter to take this photo of a snake we found on our way home. It was pretty close to our house. We live by a creek in a suburb and we see all kinds of animals on the pavement. My husband has seen a few snakes but dead so we took these for him. We had no idea this snake could really hurt Danielle. I kept yelling, &quot;Get the shot! Get the shot!&quot; While she was telling back, &quot;He's going to eat me!&quot;
