[GO HERE TO WATCH THE WHOLE THING: <a href="http://vimeo.com/14199665" rel="nofollow">vimeo.com/14199665</a>]

Abel is a 17-year-old high school student in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He and I became really good friends this summer while I was in Ethiopia. He is one of the most passionate and genuine person I've ever met.

This is his story.
