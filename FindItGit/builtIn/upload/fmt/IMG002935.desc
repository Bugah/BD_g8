BlackTron Base

My Blacktron Base, built March 2010 - My biggest moc since i came out from my dark ages - It started as a small outpost, but grew and grew, so that i had to stop the build because i run out of parts - If i ever manage to visit a convention i have to transfer it on a standart baseplate - I also tried to build some playable features and came out with a foldable entrance stairway, a Tower with a roof that can be opened and a foldable Ladder, the big canopie can be removed and there are several balconies to mount the weapons -
