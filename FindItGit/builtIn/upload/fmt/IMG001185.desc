Montecristo - Harbour Tug Boat
...how many stories...

It was quite hard to get this picture…a risky venture!

People are not allowed into the harbour, …but I didn’t give up! Since I could not walk in, I decided to try by sea… and, after an hour on my kayak, I eventually got the long sought-after picture I enclose.
