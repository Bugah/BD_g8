8Ri Scaevola
The Scaevola was used to highlight large enemy cruisers or space stations. Once the fighter marked it's target it had to quickly evade detection and return to it's main force. The marked targets would be highly vulnerable to torpedoes or artillery fire. 

I designed this with playability in mind, the cockpit opens up by pulling the rear thruster.
