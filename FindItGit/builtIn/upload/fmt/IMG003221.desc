A Gallery at Work
This is our office in downtown Austin.  At my own writeoff expense, I had a bunch of my art printed on canvas and framed to make the office a bit more colorful and fun.  We have about 60 employees, but in this office, we only have about 10.  It's the creative and biz dev HQ, and we decided not to go with traditional offices.  It's a converted loft that is all open and communal.  We all sit together, share ideas, make stupid jokes, and crank out a lot of work.  We are currently burning the midnight oil on <a href="http://www.webwars.com">WebWars</a>, which is coming along great.  Some people are currently attacking THIS website, in fact.

That's my desk right there... a little messy and a little organized, just like any curious brain, right?

I took this to go along with an interview that is coming up soon on Blu Domain for my new portfolio at <a href="http://www.treyratcliff.com">www.treyratcliff.com</a>.  I'll post a link to the interview when it is up!

Those pictures on the wall - you can see those in my &quot;Top 100&quot; set here on Flickr.
