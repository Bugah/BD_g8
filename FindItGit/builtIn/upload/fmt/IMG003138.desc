This is Sujatmi
Sujatmi's dream is that her grandkids grow up to be brave and smart. 

She is currently sitting in a makeshift annex area in a bustling riverside community in Jogjakarta, Indonesia.  Dozens of tiny thatched and improvised houses are cobbled together and brightly painted.  There are kids running around and other adults running after them, trying to get them to sit still so they can begin school.  I've accidentally interrupted the whole affair while getting confused in the tiny alleys, no wider than a set of shoulders.  She's thrilled by the excitement as she looks on, nodding at me and the kids.
