Blue hour Monaco!
The stunning little city of Monaco as seen from the Prince's palace high up. One of the most amazing places I have been to. Incredibly small (You can walk the country in 55 minutes), yet the sheer opulence of the place just blows you away. Some of the most incredible super yachts I have ever had the pleasure of seeing up close sit at that Marina below. You can walk up to them and check them out unlike here in Los Angeles where even the crappiest of dinky little boats have security that shoo you away if you are near it (from experience at Marina Del Rey). Also home of the always interesting Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix, which begins from that roadway along the marina and winds its way through the middle of the city. The highlight of my trip to Europe. If you get a chance, definitely stop by, although traffic is an absolute bitch in the day time. And if you do decide to drive the grand prix circuit, do so at night when there's no one on the streets, a lot more fun!
