Frog awakening on rose
These frogs know the meaning of the word comfort, slept inside a rose, in a non polluted place much softer and smell much better than any bedroom.

This was a gift from my mother, she found a nice subject for me, and I am very happy with this gift.

A slight problem was the fact that I wasn't with a lens capable of infinite focusing, so needed to use the Canon MP-E take the picture of this small frog. It's MP-E lens @ 1.5 magnification so the entire photo is about 16mm on horizontal.
