The New Covenant
A color and slightly different version than the first.  Definitely a favorite out of all my &quot;people&quot; photographs thus far.  Punk culture is interesting to me and I found myself intrigued by these particular kids.  Interestingly enough, I really felt a sense of &quot;family&quot; and &quot;togetherness&quot; from them even though they are perceived as rebellious by many.

My favorite is the kid with the red hair.  His wardrobe, his style, just his overall look is super cool to me.  It takes a certain boldness to wear a &quot;caution&quot; strip around your waste.  The capture of his hand sticking out is one of the best things I like about this picture because it shows vulnerability.  I had caught them all off guard that day.
