A Rainy Day In April
The fireplace and the table were taken directly from my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58252782@N06/6409354257/">Christmas At Home</a>. I really liked them and I wanted to find another way to display them. I've really wanted to do like a cool architectural shot so this suited my needs... for now :3

The fire was brightened by power functions in the back and then edited on Photoshop.

 Credit of the table goes to Joh≈ã. 

CRAP I just realized that I posted the wrong photo. The final photo had a brighter fire and some other random little things. Oh well, too late now :P
