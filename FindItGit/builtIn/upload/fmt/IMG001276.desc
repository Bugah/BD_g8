Just relax and enjoy yr summer (if you are on that side of the world) or just relax and be happy anyway is my wish to you all ;  also with this photo of my beloved sea I would like to <b>THANK</b> all my dear co-admin,  friends and contacts for the wishes for my birthday it was most appreciated and I was deeply touched and filled with joy, your friendship is precious even if some I know only &quot;virtually&quot;, but then who knows... life is full of surprises and we must be open to it. 
 &quot;It is not so much our friends' help that helps us as the confident knowledge that they will help us.&quot;
