DSC_0114 - The Cinder Track

Part of the disused railway line between Scarborough and Whitby, UK  (20+ miles) which is now a traffic-free cycle-way and walker's route.  This section is between Ravenscar and Robin Hood's Bay.  Known as the Cinder Track because the original railway line was laid, unusually, on cinders.
