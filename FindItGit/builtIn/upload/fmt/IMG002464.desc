nigardsbreen
Nigardsbreen is one of the arms of the glacier Jostedalsbreen, 
the biggest glacier in continental Europe.
While most people went by boat, we did an hour of walking/rock climbing to get there.
It was quite spectacular at times. 

There are people on the glacier but in this pic they look even smaller than ants!
