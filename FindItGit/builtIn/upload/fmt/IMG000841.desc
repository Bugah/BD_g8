Taj Mahal
Early morning fog at the Taj Mahal.
Too foggy to see Taj Mahal, but I loved the boatman going through the dense fog. The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum built under Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Charon was the ferryman of Hades, the misty and gloomy abode of the dead. Charon carried souls of the newly deceased across the river that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead.
