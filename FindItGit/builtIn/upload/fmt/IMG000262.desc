Dumbo the Bronze Elephant
Probably wouldn't have been &quot;Flickr-worthy&quot; otherwise, but I figured I'd post this today as it's the shot I was taking in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/corydisbrowphotography/5039422328/">this awesome shot that Cory posted today</a>. 

As for the shot: off camera SB-600 with CTO gel to the left of the frame provides the lighting.
