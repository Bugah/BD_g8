NATO Fast Assault Boat
<i>The F-AB (Fast Assault Boat) is usually primarily used in fast invasion operations by the NATO Navy. Equipped with a heavy AA machine gun and a lesser LMG, and designed for speed in unloading troops and heavy artillery, the Fast Assault Boat can reach a stunning 324 mph, making it one of the fastest boats in the world (although primarily, the F-AB never reaches that speed during operations). The F-AB is yet another jewel of NATO military weaponry.</i>

This was a really fun build, and I used most of my dark grey collection for it, but I'm very pleased with the result. And it fits four figs! This boat is meant to be a Navy vehicle of Carter's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carterbaldwin/2800885807/in/set-72157614822342286">NATO</a> faction. Enjoy! :)
