Camo Camion - Part 3
This is without any doubt, the most focused-on project I've undertaken. Never, ever have I been up so late working on this, trying to finish it. I've certainly gained a new understanding for the word obsession...

I'd say for the most part, this is finished. I'll likely add mudguards sooner or later. That is, once I come up with a viable design. Other than that, I think I've included all the things I had wanted to. For instance; steering, rear suspension, camouflage, interior lighting, room for a minifigure, sensor array, and a hatch. Actually, believe it or not it can hold four figures!

Those are what are consider to be the more major details, if you think there is anything else I should add, <b>let me know!</b> I can't stress that one enough. 

Whether or not you have suggestions, I hope you enjoy looking at this, I spent a lot of time; more time than ever on this. My goal was to make a realistic generic military truck with a wealth of details. I also challenged myself to use a rare colour few others use in their MOCs. I believe I've achieved all this, and perhaps more. <b>Enjoy!</b> :-)
