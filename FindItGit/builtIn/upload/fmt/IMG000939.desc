New York City
Â© 2010 Steve Kelley

New York City (NYC) viewed from Weehawken, New Jersey with a full moon rising overhead of the skyline.  Shot a little over a week ago so not sure if that is from the archives are not but since i'm not shooting anything new i guess it is.  

When i'm in the mood i'll try an post an image just for my personal mental health as i find processing the images to be very calming and takes my thoughts away from the pain.
