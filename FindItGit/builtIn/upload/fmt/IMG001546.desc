Crisp.
The sky was already full of clouds. We went in the Prannerstra√üe and we saw it already while taking shots of a Carlsson S-Class. We took only less shots, but then a man said to us: Around the corner is a Ferrari F40. We immediatily walked to the direction, the man showed us, but we couldn't find it. On top of that it started to rain. 30.04.2011
