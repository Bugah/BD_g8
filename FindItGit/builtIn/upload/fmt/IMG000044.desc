The original keep - built in the 12th century. The castle was begun at the end of the 11th century by the dukes of Normandy and the keep was constructed by Henry I of England - who happened to also be a duke of Normandy and wanted a defence against the French. In 1193 it fell into French hands and lost much of its importance.

In 1314 it was the final prison of Jaques de Molay, the last grand master of the Knights Templar.
