#1 52by52: The Ball
The official start of my new 52 week project, in synch with a new group of South West UK photographers called 52by52.  The challenge for this week was set by The Caravan Gallery and was  &quot;What you see depends on where you stand&quot;. 

The shot is actually of a huge bouncy ball which the boy was having great fun in, rolling around inside and bumping into three or four others doing the same - until I got up closer when it then looked like some bizarre sci-fi torture device with him trying to get out. Quite a weird switch of perception which hopefully fits the brief.
