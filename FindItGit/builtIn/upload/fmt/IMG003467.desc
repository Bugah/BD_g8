Moonlit Dinner
<b>Miniloc Island, El Nido</b>

This was the dinner setup for the couple I met back at El Nido. It was already late that evening as we sailed back to our island. This was also the time when the big earthquake hit Chile and the tsunami warnings were issued all over the Philippines. We were supposed to go island hopping that evening because of the bright moonlight but that didn't happen for some security reasons. So I ended up catching this shot when we got off the speed boat. The timing was also perfect as Ron &amp; Cynthia just finished their dinner and the El Nido staff agreed to let me take a couple of shots for this lovely setup.
