Art-A Game of Hearts
Various heart shapes colored and added to with art supplies.Pens, makers, pencils.JasonB art. &quot;In the end, all is vanity, but the most important thing is love.&quot;-Narcissa Weatherbee. 
Despite it all, go and love some more, and try to forgive yourself for loving when you felt no love in return and then when you did it was &quot;too late for that.&quot; Love never was right on time. But the fact that it was there is the comforting grace.
