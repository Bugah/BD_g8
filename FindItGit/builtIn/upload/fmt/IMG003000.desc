In order to get this shot, I had to get wetâ€¦ very wet.  I took off my shoes and left them on the shore and proceeded out to this rock, getting waist high into the surf, when it occurred to me that I was walking barefoot through shoreside tidal pools filled with Anemones and other things I would not want to step on barefoot.  By then I was committed and perched my tripod on another rock (much closer than my wide angle makes it appear here) and commenced taking some long exposure images with waves crashing over this rock and all around.

This surrealistic image is best described by my friend <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wwwca/">  Bill Wight </a>by his motto &quot;we are not photo journalists, we are landscape artists.&quot;
