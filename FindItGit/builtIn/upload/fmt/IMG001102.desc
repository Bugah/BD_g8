On the water in Venice
The name &quot;Venice&quot; is derived from the ancient people of Veneti that inhabited the region as of 10th century B.C. The city historically was the capital of the Venetian Republic. Luigi Barzini, writing in The New York Times, described it as &quot;undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man&quot;. Venice has also been described by the Times Online as being one of Europe's most romantic cities. (wikipedia)

I caught this shot of the Grand Canal during our visit to Venice, Italy, last fall.
