A Lovely Escapade
24/365

Daydream series #1

I'm so failing at this 365 project.

I'm having a hard time finding the right name for that teddy bear. Any suggestion? (Preferably Harry Potter, LOTR, or His Dark Materials-related) This one is a girl by the way. Oh and I like the name you suggested I'll send you a print! :) Which reminds me, does anybody want to be my pen pal? Flickrmail me :p
