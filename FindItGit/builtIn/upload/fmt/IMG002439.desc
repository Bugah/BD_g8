The Duality of Innocence
First, some credits. Thank you Bree Ann for your wonderful job painting, there's no way I could have done this without you. Also, thank you Steven for the idea to put the rose in my mouth...it worked out perfectly. 

So, there's just something about messy images that are more fun than any other kind. That being said, I think this 365 project has really distorted my sense of being &quot;messy&quot; because I still haven't washed this off and actually edited this picture still covered in paint. It was another frustrating shoot tonight, but I think that was because I spent the two hours before doing math homework. Math and I don't get along very well, but this is the last class of it I have to take so I'm just trying to survive. This was also the first time for me to work with acrylic paint, which acts really weird on the skin at least. It's like dry on top, sealing the wet stuff underneath. Anyway, I'm off to shower finally, I'm really happy with how this turned out.
