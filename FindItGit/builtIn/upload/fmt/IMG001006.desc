Eniz Gap to Wallride
It's Eniz week over here. There's so much stuff of him stacked up I thought I might share some. Barcelona, November 2006. Eniz up against the wall. 

Hasselblad 2000FC, 80/2.8, Portra 400NC. Two Nikon SB-28's to the left, 1/4 power, Two Sunpak 120's on the right, 1/8 power. Pocket Wizards for triggering.
