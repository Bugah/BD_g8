WMPTE 1N departing Wolverhampton's Park Lane Garage to work the number 20 Bushbury Hill - Wednesfield-Willenhall service in 1970. The 20 became one of the routes that would go to make up WMPTE's 25/26 Circular services in 1971, when the 20 was joined with the 25 Willenhall - Bilston - Fighting Cocks route and 26 Bushbury- Low Hill - Whitmore Reans - Chaple Ash - Goldthorn Park service. 

The MCCW bodied Guy Arab IV had been new to Wolverhampton Corporation in 1957 and was nearing the end of its service life when this picture was taken.
