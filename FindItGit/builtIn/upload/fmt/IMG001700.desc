Gone....but never forgotten!
Our &quot;cubs&quot; left last week and they will be missed, but hopefully this will open the way for some new ones in the future!
This is one from the library, it is slightly different from a previous post but I thought it was cute enough to give them one last look!
Have a fantastic weekend everyone!
