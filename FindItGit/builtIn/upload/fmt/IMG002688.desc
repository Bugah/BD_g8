<i>&quot;As a soldier in the field I couldn't</i> possibly <i>have access to those kinds of resources. That said, a good place to look might be...I don't know, the nearest nonexistent launch site in the nonexistent Sabre Program, dismissed by three administrations as preposterous rumor...

The <a href="http://www.halopedian.com/YSS-1000" rel="nofollow">UNSC YSS-1000 Sabre space fighter</a> was designed for orbital defense and used during the Fall of Reach.

My LEGO version fits both pilot and copilot and is surprisingly swooshable.  Don't worry, guys, I have plans for making the detachable booster rockets.  That's how I want it displayed at Brickworld; I want it to look like it's in liftoff.
