Solarized Crown Princess
The Crown Princess is the largest ship in the Princess Cruise Line fleet and was launched in 2006.  It carries 3,188 passengers and a crew of over 1,500.  My wife and I sailed to the southern Caribbean islands last week on this magnificent ship.

This shot on the pier in Grenada (with the solarize filter applied) gives you some sense of the size of this vessel.....
