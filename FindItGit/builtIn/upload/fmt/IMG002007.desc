Cinema Aegidium
when: july 2010
with: Bart &amp; Gegen den Strich

This old Cinema is hidden away in the heart of one of  belgium's larger cities. Just two small doors on the streetside, hardly giving away there's anything like-able behind them.
Inside i found the spectacular set of doors. 

The architecture is a mix between art-nouveau and Moorish architecture.

Really enjoyed my time inside
