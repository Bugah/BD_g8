After a long slog up to Bow Hut, we dumped our gear and continued with what was left of the light up the toe of the icefields to get a view of where we'd be playing.  Although it was pretty overcast, as the late afternoon sunlight dropped below the cloud layer, the horizontal light painted the west face of Mt. St. Nicholas as we climbed past, and the view was pretty amazing.  This mountain rocks- it is such a powerful piece of natural architecture, and it was the anchor of our entire tour.  What you can't see just the other side of that peak is some of the sweetest powder I have ever skiied...  :o)
