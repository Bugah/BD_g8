LL-216 Viper
On friday the last missing bricks arrived. So I could finish my first Vic Viper.
This ship was purely built to contribute to the missing man formations for nnenn. 

This ship and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27544165@N05/4612512488/">SI27</a> are already on their way to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/61671941@N00/">Keith Goldman</a> who gives us
a hand on bringing them to the conventions.

Edit: Finally I managed to get some <a href="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=431838" rel="nofollow">more pictures</a> reworked.
