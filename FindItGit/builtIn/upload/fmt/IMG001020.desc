The Cloud
Spotted from the boat which took us whale-watching...

I think the one most striking feature that I'll remember the most vividly from Iceland is the clouds. While I got mostly used and indifferent to the clouds at Paris' more temperate latitudes, the ones in Iceland (the first nordic country I travel to) are really fascinating, and I feel I could spend hours just watching and studying them.
