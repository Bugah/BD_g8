Gate of the ocean: heavens of the northwest
I have been away for a long time now.
Many thing have been going around in my life, and I was kept real busy for weeks. I've taken this one about a month ago at the Oregon Coast. I took this one just before sunset. The atmosphere was just starting to change color, and the light was just shifting from bright afternoon, to soft sunset intensity. I used a couple of cokin filters, a 2 f stop graduated neutral density in front of a graduated reddish-orange to light tobacco. I over exposed by 2/3 of an f/stop to bring some of the true blue'ish colors of the ocean thru the colored filter. It worked... but could have been better! :P

Many have asked me why I disabled the &quot;All Sizes&quot; button to my work, others have asked what happened to the last 10 images on my photostream (Shooting Trip) and why were they taken off. Well... both are quite related. I had to disable the all sizes because I've been selling some work and I wanted some control over larger views. I had to take off the 10 or so images from the photostream because the party that purchased them wanted to get full and exclusive rights so It had to be done, at least, for the time being.

Well, enough said!!! I'm just glad to be able to have some time for flickr again, add some pictures, and see you guys again, and see what everyone's latest is! 
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK :) ............hello everyone!
