the view from the road leading to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toomanytribbles/tags/falasarna/" target="_blank">falasarna</a>, and the title, a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pale blue dot</a>.  i've placed this on the map.

i read <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news196489543.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this</a> this morning and it's had a terrible effect on me.  it's one thing to have my personal suspicions, and quite another to see someone with serious credentials state them so publicly.

often, i feel like i'm watching a film documentary about what happened to those beings called <i>humans</i> who knew where they were headed, but did nothing to save themselves.

i posted a link on facebook...

<a href="http://www.perseus.gr/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">anthony ayiomamitis</a> said, <i>it seems rather optimistic we will be gone so quickly. really a flash.</i>

and scott said, <i>a fate we don't exactly not deserve. ;-) i'm sure the dolphins will be glad to &quot;get their life back.&quot;</i>

ken suggested i watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_2100" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">earth 2100</a>.

life is ubiquitous and tenacious on earth -- <a href="http://toomanytribbles.blogspot.com/search?q=extremophiles+" rel="nofollow">extremophiles</a> have been found in the most hostile of places -- and it most probably will continue on, oblivious to our presence... or lack of it.  some might say that it doesn't matter whether we're here or not... but that's not true.  as carl sagan said, <i>we are a way for the cosmos to know itself.</i>

notice he said <i><b>a </b></i>way and not <b><i>the </i></b>way -- maybe one way of many populations of sentient beings...

anyway, i'm all over the place with this.
