School Bells Ring Again, Lonely Swings Again
Earlier this week I was working with Natalie and we went to New Market Elementary School so she could try to get some ideas for her line assignment.  I decided I'd come back on my own this afternoon to take some shots. 

I am on this childhood kick lately, maybe because I am realizing my childhood is officially gone now.

Anywho, enjoy the image.  And maybe find a swingset and take some time and swing!!
