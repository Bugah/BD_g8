<i>(scanned image of a film photo enlarged by me in my schools darkroom. apologise for the quality of my scanner. 100ISO ilford B&amp;W film.)</i>

so i'm embarking on the <u><b>100 strangers project!</b></u>. i'm going to be using it as part of my <u>GCSE portfolio project</u> which will count as 60% of my final grade. i'm hoping to do the whole project just on film.
criticism and comments wanted - i need to improve and do well in this!

<b>OK SO YOU'RE ALL COMMENTING on how tightly i took this. it's inspired by <u>steve pyke</u> and this is how most of his work is. that is all:)</b>
