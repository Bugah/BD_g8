Just released from an LCVP, or &quot;Higgins Boat,&quot; a Willys MB Jeep and fire team from the US Army 1st Infantry Division charge up the beach toward a German machine gun nest.

Up on the ridge, the 352nd Infantry Division of the German Wehrmacht defends the coast with mortars and a leFH 18 howitzer, as officers plot their strategy near an abandoned French shepherd's cottage.
