276 366 - My little brown bear
Today was manic. I've spent half the day shopping for new clothes [for V&amp;C] and party bits and the rest food shopping for aforementioned party.  Next year I'm having a joint party with Bo [got that yash].

Anyway, V's got her party dress and C's got some of his Autumn/Winter wardrobe.  I got sod all. Sob. And there are a million Charlie and Lola things in my house.  I also got 60 bottles of beer. Nice.

PS - k will HATE this hat but I think he looks damn cute and he's my baby so he can sod off.
