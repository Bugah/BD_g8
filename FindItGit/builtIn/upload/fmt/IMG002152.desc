Who us?? Nooo we would NEVER try to find a way out.
This is Thor and Boo Boo, they along with Michael were enjoying their first day out on exhibit. We were very lucky to be there that day as the boys were having so much fun. Being their first day they were intrigued by every plant, rock, water feature and moat (more on that later, notice Michael is not pictured). Don't they look a little guilty to you?
