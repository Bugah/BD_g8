Fall Color (just not the kind youâ€™re expecting)

The amazing thing about my camera is that is usually tends to chase off nice clouds and colors like this.  I spent many cold mornings shooting this bridge at sunrise last winter and not once came away with anything quite this nice.  At least as far as the sky and clouds are concerned.  My plans last Friday morning were to shoot some of the buildings downtown at sunrise, like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwellsphotography/4103062649/">the Stephens Building</a>, but when I got downtown I noticed that the eastern sky was hinting around at what was to be a pretty spectacular sunrise, so I hopped across the river, set up, and fired off a few shots of the Rock Island Bridge against a beautiful blue hour sky.

Ever so slight contrast boost, but that's about all.  The light and color was about as perfect as it could be.
