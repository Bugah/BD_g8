Concept for augmented reality mobile phone
Blogged at <a href="http://mlearning.edublogs.org">The Mobile Learning Blog</a>. Here's my idea for a really cool mobile phone.  A curved transparent OLED screen renders augmented reality data in front of the user's POV, using a camera mounted on one (or both) side(s).  The OLED screen is touch sensitive on the *outside* to allow the user to touch the visor and interact with the device.  The visor can be stowed over the head (like a headphone band) when not in use.  Smaller, more streamlined earphones could make the phone lighter and sleeker.  Information about the user's surroundings could be provided to the user in real time, as well as playing of related video or audio content.
