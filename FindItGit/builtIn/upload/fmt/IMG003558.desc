Below is an excerpt from my travel blog.  Cheers.

As I mentioned before, Sydney is full of light.  Everything is illuminated in some way shape or form, making night photography very interesting.  I am told they filmed most of the first movie in the Matrix series throughout downtown Sydney.  Not only was it much cheaper at the time, but also downtown Sydney strikingly resembles most downtown American cities.  

I shot this while walking back from the Sydney harbor.  I looked up and the light from the street level really seemed to extend up to the sky.  Everyone walking by kept stopping to look up to see what I was photographing. When you shoot at night as with this shot, you really have some long exposure times.  Some of the HDR shots needed to make this image required exposure times of up to 30 seconds.  This is how the lights at the street level become so funky. The bright light is a result of cars passing by within that long exposure time.  I enhanced it a bit through masking in photoshop but the lights at the bottom really give the photo extra dynamism and movement.
