Minnie the Dreamer
Last night when we got home Minnie was on the table being ultra cute so I had to get some shots of her looking adorable, it was a bonus that the Christmas lights in the background created such a fun bokeh.

I could not choose just one shot to post so I posted 4, what's your favorite?
