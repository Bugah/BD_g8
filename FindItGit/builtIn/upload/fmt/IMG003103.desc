Yaqui Point Dawn, South Rim, Grand Canyon, Arizona
Im not a morning person but I will always be thankful to my brother who is and got me up at 4:30 on a December day a few years back to see the sun rise on the canyon. It was so cold but so so worthwile to see those shadow dance over the greatest valley of time in the American southwest.  Somewere a mile down is the Colorodo River carving her way through the centuries. Blessings
