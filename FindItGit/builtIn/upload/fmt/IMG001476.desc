YH-1 Train
My class in Gamleby Fotoskola.
Pro 7b head in a small softbox, camera right, and another 7b head in a big softbox, camera left for the pictures of my classmates. The train was shot with an Elinchrom Ranger Quadra head in a beauty dish, camera left.
All the rocks were shot in natural light and the  tunnel is a 3D model I made.
All strobes triggered by cable.
