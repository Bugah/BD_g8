The great wide open
Much to my delight, this photo seems to have taken on a life of its own on tumblr, with well over 20,000 (and sort of counting - it's split into many many different threads) reblogs, comments, and likes. Some of the comments have been extremely moving, and make me happy to have had a chance to reach people who I will never meet, will never know me, and probably will never see a single other photo I have taken. It seems to mean a lot to some people - upon clicking through to one blog recently I read a comment that possibly sums up every single piece of motivation for why I take pictures. It said simply &quot;This gives me hope&quot;. 

Same story as the  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amirjina/4177168648/in/set-72157622856586007/">last picture</a>: In the 1930s and 1940s, Puerto Rico was almost totally deforested for agriculture (chiefly as sugar, coffee and tobacco plantations for export to the United States). Now, forests cover around 50% of the island. Some other Columbia students and I have been researching what factors brought about this change.

 In the northern karst region we found a limestone cave, which, after winding through it in total darkness, opened out on a sheer cliff face, with a breathtaking view of a lush, forested valley beneath.

Look at the flickr selection of my interesting photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amirjina/sets/72157600234171824/with/4177167252/">here</a>.
