Zone 2011 There will be blood(s)...
Perfect day for painting today in North Carolina...we had the boom box going, and there were a bunch of Piru's scoping from the other end of the park..I thought I was back in SD painting on Skyline or something...Connector later  when the sun goes away from the other side...Lets get it Brackin!  Big up to Woem on coming up with the crazy color scheme.
