Omadal, Semporna - The young Sea Gypsies and their Floating Village
Press L to view in Large

Omadal island was the first place we visited. The residents here are of Bajau origin (Sea Gypsy) and they build their houses on water. The first word that the children spoke to us was 'minta' (asking for money). At the end we gave them sweet.

These little girl and her brother gave us the best impression as they did not ask for anything but just followed us in their small boat. We gave them some sweet and souvenir. They are so adorable.
