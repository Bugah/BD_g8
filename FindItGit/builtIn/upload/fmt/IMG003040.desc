Milky Way Over Longs Peak
The Milky Way passes to the west of Longs Peak (14,255 feet) in Rocky Mountain National Park. 

This is a stitch of 12 images taken with the camera riding piggyback on the telescope for tracking. Tracking was done with PHD Software. Each of the 12 images is comprised of a stack of four 30 second exposures taken at ISO 1600 with the modified Canon 450D through the 50mm lens set at f/2.2. The light pollution glow from Denver in the lower left corner of the photo made it hard to match color and brightness between the shots - I'll have to try again, maybe with a light pollution filter. For the landscape, a separate set of photos were taken from a tripod at the same time and place and was overlayed into the shot. This was done to avoid motion blur caused by the telescope tracking with the stars.
