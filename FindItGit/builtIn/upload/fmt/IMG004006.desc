I thought it might be nice to let you know what <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zombiecoterie/">Howard</a> and I have been working on lately. 

As you know, Howard is a very talented artist, and since his book about a little <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zombiecoterie/sets/72157607529440628/">badger</a> wwent down so well, he's started on a grander project, which I will be colouring. 

If you, or anyone you know, might be interested in having a look with a view to publishing please drop me a line on here - the sample and synopsis will shortly be ready for you to have a look at.

Fun!
