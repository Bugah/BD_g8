S V
<i>Maarten Memorial 2010</i>

A dashboard shot of the <u>matte black</u> <b>Lamborghini Murciélago LP670-4 SV-R</b>

This car is brought by Reiter, in München, to install their spoiler and exhaustsystem. The owner of the car takes his car to the track regulary and found he needed more downforce.

This SuperVeloce is actually the second of the 2 SV's in the Netherlands, I'm glad I've seen them both.
