Two Stems & An Angel
Even the smallest of things... look alot better when they're in the right place.

I saw this orange beauty while I was heading to my car after work. Luckly, I had my camera, and my macro lens hooked up already. I chased it around for a few minutes and took a few shots. I will be posting a few more of this butterfly over the next few days.
