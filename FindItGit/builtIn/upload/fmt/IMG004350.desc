Light in the Dark -- Antelope Canyon (Explored)
Thanks Explore -- October 8, 2011!

At certain times in the day, the sun is able to stream into the canyon through tiny openings, creating magical rays like this. The light bounces off crystals in the eroded sandstone, resulting in constant changes in color -- from deep blues and purples to gold. Love this place!
