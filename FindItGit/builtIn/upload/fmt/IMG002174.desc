This picture was shot on a tripod with three exposures (-2..0..+2 EV). I used Photomatix Pro to create the HDR with tone mapping and detail enhanced. I increased the overall saturation with Hue/Saturation in Photoshop. Curve adjustment to increase the overall contrast. 1 layer mask in soft light mode at 50% gray, using brush tool to lighten and darken some areas of the image, to bring out details. Used Nik Sharpener Pro to sharpen image.

I was heading up to the Japanese Garden again. But I had forgotten that it was free admission day to the Japanese Garden on 11.11.11. There were hundreds of people and the parking lot was full along with traffic jam. So, I turned around and headed down to the Oregon Holocaust Memorial instead. Besides, I had not seen the place. This is one of the several bronze art at the Memorial. For more info about the Memorial, please click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohrconline.org/community/memorial/" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>
