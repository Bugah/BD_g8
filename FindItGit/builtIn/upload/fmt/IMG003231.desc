thank you for being there for me
to my family, relatives, and friends...at times of happiness and of sadness...of joys and of hurts...of inner peace and of anger and fears...thank you for your forbearance and understanding...sorry for anything i may have done to offend you...but thank you for still being there for me...love, a friend...
