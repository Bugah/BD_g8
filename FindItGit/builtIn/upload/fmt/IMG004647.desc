Little Corner of Cyberspace
Why oh why tell the world your innermost personal thoughts? Why micro blog your private sensitive reflections to the world? Is something lacking in our lives? Is there a void, created by poor parenting, degenerating society, cultural or political egotism? Why do we feel such a need to cast what’s on our minds, out into the void of cyberspace?
I do often wonder why some cross the line (what would be my line anyway), and discuses deeply personal issues, for the rest of the world to see?  Just how much ‘do’ we need to be listened to? Do we really benefit from our own little corner of cyberspace that much, that we run our own soap operas and publish our minds workings for all to see...

I wonder how much the metamorphosis in or communities, our differing more stressful way of life leave a void that online communities fill? Am I getting too personal? Should I explore my own troubled childhood? Who would be interested in my absent father, my physiological frailties, and my relationship complications anyway....? Just who would be interested? 

It’s strange how writing this from a personal computer, in a safe place distorts what you are prepare to divulge...Anyway, the image I’ve posted here has no relation to my personal issues...I just like it, and today that, for me is enough.
