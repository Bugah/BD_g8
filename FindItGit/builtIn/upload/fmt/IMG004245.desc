The Warm Rock.
This rock was briefly illuminated by the morning sun just breaking over the trees at the Upper Falls at Caney Creek.  Technically, the rock was not warm, but it looked like it with the golden rays of the first light.  

I took this shot underneath the shelf across from the falls.  It provides some fantastic angles of the falls and down the creek itself.
