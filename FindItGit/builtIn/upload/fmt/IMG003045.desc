Happy Earth Day! Go Green!!
22nd April  2011 is Earth Day. In this photo you can see wind power being used to generate electricity. There are a myriad of windmills in the city of Twentynine Palms, California generating electricity.

A lot of viewers have asked me how to get the sunburst effect - there are two ways to do it - either use a sunburst filter - they come in various sizes or you can set a high aperture value - f/8 or above - depending on lens (all lenses don't do this and you will have to try out different aperture values before coming to a good result)  and then post process it to get the perfect effect you need!
