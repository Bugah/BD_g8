This Earth week on Miniature Sunday we have planetary digi-magic that meets our Toy-ronto :-)
With love to our little planet and with combined magic forces here it is a new perspective on a lovely idyllic Withrow Park, located in Greektown of our Toronto.

More of Toy-ronto fun is coming on your screens next Miniature Sunday! 
Stay tuned / bientot a l'ecran ;-)
