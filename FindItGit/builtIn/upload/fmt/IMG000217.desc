Face Melting guitar solos!
I been on a serious classic rock spree lately listening to everything from the 60's 70's and some 80's that have serious guitar execution in them...Its been a while since i hunted and today , my patience paid off...tha sun an moon and tha stars were all aligned and everyhing went off without a problem...had to chill for a bit  at one point but i might as well have had a lunch break or somethin....Thanks to Q for tha day...I had a blast!
