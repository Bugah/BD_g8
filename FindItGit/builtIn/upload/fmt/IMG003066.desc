The Market at Night
I arrived in Barcelona very late. Actually, this may be the only time in which Barcelona even exists.

There is a fabulous market right in this very location that is apparently open in something called the 'daytime&quot;. The &quot;daytime&quot; is a mystical time that most people in Barcelona don't even know exists.

I know this for sure because the next morning, at 9 AM on a WEEKDAY, I could not find any place open to buy coffee. People sleep in until approximately 3 PM. They then roll around in bed, thinking about getting up until 4 PM. They then get up, have some chocolate and churros, and then take a quick nap before it gets dark. And then they party.
