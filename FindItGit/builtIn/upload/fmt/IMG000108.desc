Donald Duck Portrait
I really love this Donald sculpture in the PhilharMagic gift shop.  Heck, I really love PhilharMagic in general.  Heck, I really love three of the four 3D shows at Walt Disney World.  MuppetVision and PhilharMagic I consider especially great.  Now if Imagination could just get on the ball with something new...and NOT Captain EO.
