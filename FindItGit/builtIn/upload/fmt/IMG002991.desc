After taking LSD. I lighting up a candle in the middle of the wood and during the 4 minute of exposure, i make a meditation about the holism of nature surrounding me. Feeling the crystal vibration irradiating  from the center of the Gaia mother earth. So in this picture i try to show you the magic,sacred metaphysical quality of the nature and new age bullshiting you .
