At dusk
@Davis bay, Sunshine coast, BC

Our first night at Sunshine coast.  I was so attracted by the beautiful sunset.  Again, I can't help to waste so many films here, almost like entire roll.  And again, I can't choose which one to post cause I like all of them.  So I think I will post them all one by one in the future.  : )
