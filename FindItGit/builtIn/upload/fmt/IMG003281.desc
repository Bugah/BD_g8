Can you hear the sweet melody of beauty?
still working on the photographs of the wedding a few days ago, uploading one or two of them which I please best. as the postprocessing´s taking up all my free time (there are quite a few of them) I´m not able to take new pictures at the moment.

if you like to see how I processed this picture, have a look <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/afterclass/discuss/72157603228964378/#comment72157603283681779">here</a>.

only a few days until I´ll purchase some new equipment much longed for: a wide angle lens and a studio flash system. another reason why I don´t do new pictures at the moment, I´m dying to finally try out the new stuff. it´s a safe bet that you´ll notice it when I´ll do the first trials.. ;-)
