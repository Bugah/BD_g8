Welcome to the World ( Happy Mom`s day!)
&quot;Let me welcome you to this World
And let me tell you of my World
How it is...
You want to know now...
Welcome to the World child
You'll begin to find
That fight as you fight as you will in life
 Solutions, confusions
Won't you take this time now
I want to welcome you to this World
And yes, there'll be days and nights
Round and round the World we go
Easy come, some say, easy go
The World could be a better place...&amp;quot
