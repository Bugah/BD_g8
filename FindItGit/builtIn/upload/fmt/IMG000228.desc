Karl XV
My 100th picture to get Explored!

Like I said yesterday no more churches for a week! Instead I add one more HDR to the  Monument collection. This statue on Djurg√•rden represent Charles XV, King of Sweden and Norway (Charles IV) between 1859 to 1872.


HDR made from three handheld shots, AEB -2, 0 +2. Equipment: Canon EOS 500D and EF-S10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM. Processed with Photomatix Pro 4.0, Photoshop Elements 7.0, Topaz Adjust 4 and Noise Ninja.

Please don't use my photos without my permission!
