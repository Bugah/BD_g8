Bang bang you're dead!
I was taking pics of my daughter this morning when all of a sudden this little guy jumped in front of my camera, telling me to put my hands up or he was, &quot;gonna blow me away.&quot;

I couldn't resist grabbing a few shots, especially with the determined look on his face. Funny thing is, he is normally a very nice little kid.
