Our Dream World  106/365
Say hello to Joey!  She is named after my DH because she arrived on his birthday!  (His name is Joe.)  haha...I told him that she is a great present!  :D  Dollies always seem to arrive when I am short of time!  Will take more pix later...too wet outside to put her in the grass!  Haven't had time to wash and condition her hair...but it is good!  I love her...she is the most different dolly that I have seen from Takara in a while!  I love her matte face...it feels like silk!  I couldn't say no the the first FBL!
