Happy Sunday! 快樂星期天!!
This photo was taken yesterday afternoon at the country side down south. I was very lucky that I found this place full of little yellow flowers. This flowers are actually wild and growing in winter time. They are called Soursobs.

They actually came from South Africa long time ago, someone brought them here as a garden flowers. Eventually. it just spread like weeds. Australian hated soursobs though, and same do I!!! Because they will just growing in your garden like weeds!!

I only like them in the country side or big field, because they do look good when the whole big area covered with this yellow flowers~  

Have a great sunday everyone!!
