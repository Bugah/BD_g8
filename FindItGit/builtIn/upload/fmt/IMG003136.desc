The Beijing National Stadium (北京国家体育场) also known as the &quot;Bird's Nest&quot; (鸟巢) for its architecture is a stadium finished for the Olympic Green in Beijing, China that was completed in March 2008. The stadium will host the main track and field competitions for the 2008 Summer Olympics, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. (Source: wikipedia)

I normally try to avoid halo in my HDR, but I purposely left it there for this one. I quite like the halo effect on the 鸟巢.  :)
