Good Morning...!!!
&quot;Good morning to the day, and next, my gold!
Open the shrine that I may see my saint.&quot;
  - Ben Johnson (English Dramatist and Poet, 1572-1637)

&quot;If you have only one smile in you, give it to the people you love. Don't be surly at home, then go out in the street and start grinning &quot;Good morning&quot; at total strangers.&quot;  - Maya Angelou (American poet, b.1928)
