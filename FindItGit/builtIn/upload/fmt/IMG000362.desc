Smokey Mountain, Tondo - Girl behind that little window
I spotted this little girl behind a small shop in Smokey Mountain. She was having her lunch and taking care of the little shop.

Those residents who are better well off would set up stalls like this in the garbage dump site. They are like the 7-eleven stalls selling many things but operating only in the days.
