a gorgeous saturday night, i was up on the hill of griffith park looking for some night shots.  the surroundings were rather dark and filled with many people.  i found a hi-spy view machine and decided to shoot bokeh of the city lights instead.  focus was hard, because i couldn't really see much due to the dim environment.  

anyway.... i wish all my friends a colorful week ahead.   =)
