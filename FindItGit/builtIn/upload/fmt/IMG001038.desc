A Night at the Museum
This is one of the final photos I was able to squeeze off before the security guards nabbed me. Arg! I wanted to get so many more… but you know, you know… it’s the same old story.

Anyway, if you ever visit Paris, you absolutely need to make it over here to the museum of natural history. It’s known to the locals, but not to visitors. All the other sites in Paris are great, of course… but if you have a penchant for science and a love of crazy interior design, this is the place for you!
