Thunakkadavu Lake Lit Up
The Thunakkadavu reservoir or lake is a phtographers delight with the daily sunset throwing a rash of wild red colors over the sky and the clean waters reflecting the burning skies. Here a quick storm seems to be brewing in the evening and it did engulf the whole area later on in relentless rain.

This is a part of a wild life sanctuary and entry and exit is controlled. What is perhaps the best point about this wonderful sanctuary is that there is hardly any human vs animal conflict and therefore one can see wild life at very close quarters. Of course, it is not run over by the supreme predator of all and the roaming numbers are not large, so it is a great place ...still. !!!
