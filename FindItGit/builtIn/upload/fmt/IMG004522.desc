Stone Heart
Today is our wedding anniversary and we went for a wonderful drive along Lake Superior.  We made several stops along the coast and I took loads of photos.  While we were walking along a stream that flowed into Lake Superior, I saw this rock that was shaped like a heart.  How cool is that!?!  I wanted to bring it home, but when I picked it up, it was so heavy (weighed about 25 pounds) and since we were quite a distance from our car, I had to leave it.  So...my heart is still in that beautiful stream.
