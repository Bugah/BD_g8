Heliconius ethilla Butterfly
Yet another little challenge in finding this butterfly's id. It looks a lot like a Lycorea cleobaea (aka tiger mimic queen, large tiger butterfly) and Mechanitis lysimnia... 
but it's a Heliconius ethilla narcaea, also known as helicon, silly mary (borboleta maria-boba... que nome bobo =/)


Heliconius comprise a colorful and widespread brush-footed butterfly genus distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. These butterflies utilize Passion flower plants as their larval food source and rely on bright wing color patterns to signal their distasteful to potential predators (aposematism). It may have many color patterns and subespecies variations.
Hybrid speciation has been found to occur in this genus, which makes identification even harder...
