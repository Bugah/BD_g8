Magical nights of Bruges (3) - Press L
Bruges is a <b>fairytale paradise in tiny Belgium</b>. You are immediately transported back in time to <b>medieval Europe</b>, a period when the primary mode of transport was by horse and carriage. The city is popular with visitors worldwide for <b>its canals</b> as well as locally produced lace, chocolate, and beer.
<b>Bruges is called the ‘Venice of the North’ because of its canals</b>. In the Middle Ages, <b>these canals were used by ships to deliver goods to the city and to take exports from local merchants</b>. For this reason, Bruges was a very rich and prosperous town. Today the canals are used primarily for <b>tourism and leisure.</b>
