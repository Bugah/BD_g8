YSS-1000 Sabre WIP
It was a good call when I ordered the parts to finish my Shotgun that I bought more than I needed for it! Turns out I needed those parts for my Sabre.

Some of you guys were worried I was quitting this project. Setting it aside for a couple months really helped me look for a way to build the underside with fresh eyes on the project.

Order of business for this project: underside, then two side boosters, followed by lower wings, and finally detachable booster pods. No guarantees on this being ready for Brickworld though.
