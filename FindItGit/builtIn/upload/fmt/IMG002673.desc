The 'Gulmohar' Fire Dance
I absolutely love the Gulmohar flowers! The colors are captivating. I live in a <a href="http://r2blore.blogspot.com/2007/06/summer-of-07.html" target="_blank">city</a> that has plenty of Gulmohar trees! Here's a shot that I enjoyed capturing.

Picasa Edit: Cropped mildly on 3 sides. Added a little shadow to bring out the colors.
NOTE: The colors are original and are not saturated!
