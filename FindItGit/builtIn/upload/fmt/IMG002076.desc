S n a k e trail ツ
Something different today, I call it Snake trail ツ me and my friend Azaga come up with this in my last trip to the festival in Ghadames city, the Idea is: we put our camera in the middle of the road and come a cross them by the car and once then car passing a way, the driver turn the car left and right, then we say WOW we come with something new, enjoy, thanks my friend and hope you like it.
