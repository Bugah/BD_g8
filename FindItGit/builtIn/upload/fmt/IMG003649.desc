Swiss Army Knife on Cuusoo
This is a remake of one of my first MOCs shared on flickr in 2010.The new version is more stable, looks better and has one more tool! Besides, you can help to make it a real LEGO product by supporting it on LEGO <a href="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/21267" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuusoo</a> I'd really appreciate that.
