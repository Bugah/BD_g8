Food Week 2008 - Friday
Nasi Padang

Loosely translated Nasi Padang means Padang style rice platter. It is usually rice with meat such as chicken or beef and some kinds of curries. Padang is a city/region in the Indonesian Island of Sumatra. It's hot and spicy cuisine is my absolute favorite style of Indonesian cooking. This version from <b>Bamboo Village</b> is the closest I can get to the real thing in San Francisco.
