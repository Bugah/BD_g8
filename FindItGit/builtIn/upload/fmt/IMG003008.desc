When the Space-Time Continuum Collides with Plastic
Possilble, albeit not that plausible, explanation of what could happen if plastic is thrown into the space-time continium - Bokeh Explosion.   Makes you think twice about promoting the use of those disposable water bottles!  Long live my Nalgene and can I have more Eggnog please!!

I made up the whole &quot;Space-Time&quot; thing for the title, it really is just a plastic fence.
