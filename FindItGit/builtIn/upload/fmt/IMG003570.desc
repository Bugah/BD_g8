Tropical Pool
Nightshot of the pool of the Bangkok Marriott Resort &amp; Spa, Thailand. There's a pool bar to the right and a hat water jacuzzi between the palms in the background. 
There were people swimming in the pool, but you can't see them, because of the long exposure. The water just looks a bit strange.
