Salinger
Promo picture for <a href="http://www.myspace.com/salingersounds" rel="nofollow">Salinger</a>.  Salinger is a screamo band, but it isn't all screaming.  The guys may be a bit blurry due to the 20mph winds (30km/h) and multiple flash pops.

This is my first photo for the Strobist.com pool aside from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/soundman1024/2171455050/">this</a> joke that I didn't send to the pool.  I'm sure I'll be taking more that fit into the pool in the future.


Camera info: Tripod mounted Nikon D40 w/ <a href="http://www.rentglass.com" rel="nofollow">rented</a> 10.5mm f/2.8G Fisheye triggered by ML-L3 remote
Exposure info: 11.5s @ f/5.6 ISO200  Exposure time was just how long it too me to press the remote, do the flash pops, and get back in sight of the IR sensor to close the shutter.  It also happened to expose the sky nicely.
Light/<b>Strobist.com</b> info: Relatively light night (not dusk) sky.  3 flash pops from one Nikon SB-28 at 1/4 power 50mm.  All pops were from different places, one for the side of the excavator, one for the four by the excavator, and one for Justin on the bucket
Processing info: I used the JPG instead of the RAW.  Cropped to 5x7 aspect ratio, dropped the shadows some, Noise Ninja'd it to smooth the sky (kept the original jeans, jeans look fake after Noise Ninja) and added a watermark
