Iglesia de la Concepción, San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, México
The Church and Convent of La Concepcion, once the largest religious complex in San Miguel, is located two blocks west of the jardin. The compound is topped by a monumental dome modeled after that of the Eglise du Dome of the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris. A two-storied portion of the convent surrounding a patio, one of the largest in colonial New Spain, is now Bellas Artes, a cultural center where classes are held in painting, music, language and other subjects. Huge ancient trees shade the patio and the fountain in the center. There is a small cafe in a corner of the ground floor. A relaxing tea break at one of the outdoor tables, shaded by the overhanging porch, must be one of the best kept secrets in San Miguel. Bellas Artes students undoubtedly would prefer that it remain so. (From an <a href="http://www.softadventure.net/sanmigel.htm" rel="nofollow">article by Harlan Hague at Softadventure</a>)
