great dane highstreet love
if anything this is for my wife. Lincoln highstreet was filled with great danes for a charity. What I love most about this is that dogs bring great joy to strangers who have never meet them. From current dog owners to german tourists who were wowed at the size of these dogs and ran away everytime one came close. As I was kneeing to get a low pov I was just trying not to get my face slobbered or licked.
