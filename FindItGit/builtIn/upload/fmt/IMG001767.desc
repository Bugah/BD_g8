  Thank you everyone!
Geez, what more could you want? He has his meatbone, chew ball and the beautiful Serengeti, eh, Arizona desert. I went to the Out of Africa place near Verde yesterday for the first time and man, the rain and cold hit near the end.  I know this lion is centered, but this is my first time photographing them. They don't sit very long.  Is he grinning?
