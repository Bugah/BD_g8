Breakfast in The ANA's First Class!
One of flight attendants offered to take a photo of me in the ANA's first class shellflat seat for the first time in my life!
Despite of the spacious area for a aircraft, a camera with wide angle lens is needed to get this shot... so I handed Kodak V705 with 23mm lens for this shoot!
