Tourists
Every year a large number of swans fly in from foreign parts to spend the winter in Ireland.  Quite a few of them return  year after year to a short stretch of the Grand Canal between Portobello Bridge and Clanbrassil Street Bridge, Dublin.  There are a couple of restaurants along this stretch and I've seen staff throwing the birds stale bread.  And others feed them too.
