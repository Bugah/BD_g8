Facebook Cover Photo
This is my facebook profile. I love the new timeline it's great UI design that displays lots of information in a gorgeous way. Better yet you get a cover photo to play with! Here is my take so far on the creative photo cover people have been doing. I'm sure it will change with time, but for now this just works =) Anyone else have fun profiles to look at? Leave your links in the comments so I can check them out.
