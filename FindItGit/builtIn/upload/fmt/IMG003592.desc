Midnight Sun
Gotta see this one <a href="http://www.bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=3533634292&amp;size=large" rel="nofollow">large on black</a>!

Looking to the south, straight down the centerline of the ruins of the old 3rd Echelon Maintenance Hangar at the Rattlesnake Bomber Base in the tiny, far west Texas desert town of Pyote.  Note the Iwo Jima mural on the near end of the left wall, one of three different patriotic murals found on the inside corners of the ruins.

Night, full moon, slight ambient sodium vapor light.  Composite of two exposures at f/16 &amp; f/5.6.
