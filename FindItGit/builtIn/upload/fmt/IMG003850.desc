Caethglud yr ebol*
A white horse happily eating his lunch near to the entrance of Old Cilgwyn Farm.


The heading roughly translated ‘THE CAPTIVITY OF THE PONY‘ is the title of a poem by Crwys (http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-WILL-WIL-1875.html) about a pony being taken by a dealer from the freedom of the Frenni Fawr, Pembrokeshire to be sold.  This horse however was very happy having a great time eating his lunch
