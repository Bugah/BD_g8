Midnight Crocus
<b>&hearts; EXPLORE &hearts;.....2-25-09.....Best Position #11....THANK YOU FRIENDS! </b>

I may not have to venture far for colors in the near future...<i> like to Lowes or Home Depot, hahaha</i>..... as I'm starting to see signs of Spring in my own back yard. These are crocuses that have come up in my flowerbed. They're really yellow, but I had fun &quot;tweaking&quot; them and this was the final result. Hope you like it.
