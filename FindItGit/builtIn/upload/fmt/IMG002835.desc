Shanghai Light-Stream
 <b>Â© All rights reserved. </b>
For a change then before I litter my stream with mountain top sunsets and rises - a cityscape. This is Shanghai at night - this beautiful roundabout sits in front of the Oriental Pearl TV Tower and has a raised walkway all the way around it.. It has a real funky space age look about it.

Please don't place links to your own images as they will be removed - thanks.
