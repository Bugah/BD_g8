Избуяла
There's no exact translation, but it means something like 'vigorously overgrown' (dictionaries also suggest luxuriant, lush or rank but none is 100% exact). Usually applies to grass or plants, sometimes to hair (what was that?)...

I love shooting chaos, scenes with no 'main' subject, leaving the viewer's eye (and mind) to wander unguided and unrestrained.
