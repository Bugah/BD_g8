Bedugul, Bali - Ferrying the Ogor Ogor from Pura Ulun Danu
The Abangan boys were seen here ferrying the Ogor Ogor from the Pura.

After Tanah Lot, this is perhaps the most photographed temple on the island and is certainly one of the iconic images of Bali. The temple sits on the western shore of Lake Bratan and it can give the illusion of actually floating on the water. Built in 1633, the temple is devoted to Ida Batara Dewi Ulun Danu, goddess of the lake.
