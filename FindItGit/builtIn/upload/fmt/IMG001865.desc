Red-billed Quilea
These little birds are known to fly in flocks of sometimes a few hundred thousand to millions! They can really darken the sky and are the most common bird in the world, at least looking at the numbers.. You wonÂ´t actually see them like on this picture as they fly very fast. It looks like more or less clouds which move like waves.

South Luangwa Valley, Zambia.
