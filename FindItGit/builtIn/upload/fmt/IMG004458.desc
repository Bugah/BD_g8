Coastguard Rescue Helicopter (Whiskey Bravo) - Freshwater Bay, Isle of Wight
A bit of quick and dirty clone action (that sounds like a line from a low-budget sci-fi porn film :)

Tricky to perform as i wasn't set up for a clone shot, just heard the chopper approaching and grabbed a hand-held sequence.
