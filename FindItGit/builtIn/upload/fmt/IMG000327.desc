You Unlock This Door With the Key of Imagination...
Witness if you will, a Hotel from the Golden Age of Hollywood, trapped in limbo.  What's known in the parlance of the times as the old switcheroo, from day to night in the blink of an eye.  If you're lucky, the hotel has some vacancies in the area between day, night, the sky, and the earth...in the Twilight Zone.

Credit for this idea goes to Tim Devine over at TheMagicInPixels.com (similar work can also be seen on Corsey21's photosteam).  This was more of an afterthought than a planned shot, so hopefully next time I can actually stand in a similar spot for the two shots, and save myself considerable post processing time!
