9 Months Later
Just one poppy has appeared in the Tonto National Forest, east of Cave Creek, Arizona, 9 months after a wildfire decimated the area.  This is a place where I've found to collect great rocks for my garden and for creating <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cobalt/98266573/">inukshuk</a> guardian statues.  In this area, the dirt and dust is all gray, with even the rocks in the wash covered with the debris and ash.  Suprising to find this ONE flower blooming there on Sunday!  The color of the petals is accurate - that is how much it stands out.  The color of the soil and ash is still very gray.  For some reason, my camera picked up more blue to the gray ash, but here it is, as a striking image of beauty amid the devastation.
