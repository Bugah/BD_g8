when the battle has been won (1 of 2)
part of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brianday/sets/72157623447913139">emergency response</a> set...

These guys call it like they see it.  They were making fun of the chief (standing just out of the frame to the right), who was apparently being a bit of a poser as I was photographing the scene.  I'll have to do some digging and post one or two of those next (**update: it's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brianday/5018996644">it's here</a>**), it was actually kinda funny...

I'm rarely interested in the fire itself, but as usual, these guys wasted no time taking care of business.  With incredible coordination, the &quot;box alarm&quot; blaze (this time, a pile of clothes in an abandoned house) was under control in pretty short order, and no one was injured...

Overworked, underpaid, and understaffed?  No doubt.  But still, they get it done.  No questions asked.
