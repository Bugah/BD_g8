Nokia 770 (with notes)
This is the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet that I received the other day.  It runs on top of Debian Linux and has a large 800x480 touch-screen.  I actually have an xterm app for it so that I can access a BASH shell and issue command line commands.  Very cool little box when you consider that it can use WIFI or Bluetooth (to a phone) in order to access the internet.
