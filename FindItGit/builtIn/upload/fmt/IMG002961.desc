Modifided TS-82 'Primal Megan'
There was some Reaver influence here, and even the idea for the cable and hook capture method came from Firefly. I love that show.

Possibly the most loathed and feared pirate craft in widespread use, the &quot;Tanglers&quot; use steel cables and grapnels to pierce a ship's hull, and then can manipulate the victimized craft by using their reverse thrusters. Even though the craft is armed with conventional weaponry, the more vicious pirate pilots prefer to kill the ship's crew by using excessive G-Forces by swinging the captured craft in circles.
