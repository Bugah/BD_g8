We played with clay today!
Friends, Sam and Mel wanted to learn to model roses and so I taught them today. I made the yellow one, Sam made the purple one and Melody made the red one. She was delighted at her first attempt at modelling anything!  Melody has cerebral palsy and this was a major accomplishment for her.

Isaiah 35:1-4
1 <b>The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. </b>2 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God. 3 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. 4 Say to them that are of a fearful  heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.
