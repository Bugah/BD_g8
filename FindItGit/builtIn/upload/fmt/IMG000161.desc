Green ants are very common in North Queensland. They build nests made from the leaves of the host tree. The bite of a green ant can be a bit painful and very annoying if they attack simultaneously.

However, green ants are a traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tucker">bush tucker</a> of the local Aboriginal people. In recent years, some local restaurants have started serving chocolate-dipped green ants. Apparently, the citrus tang of the green ant's abdomen goes well with the sweet chocolate.
