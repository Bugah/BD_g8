The Shaft
Casa Batll√≥ on Passeig de Gracia is one of the most awesome places in the world.  My camera was very happy (and me, by extension).

This is one of Antoni Gaudi's masterpieces.  That guy is amazing...  It was certainly on my list to visit before the trip, and I did not really have enough time to spend there.  And, I couldn't use the tripod, but I don't want to get into that discussion...just too frustrating.

&quot;The Shaft&quot; runs up the center of the casa.  It reminds me of how each floor was a completely different visual experience.  Taking photos in here was a challenge... I wanted to do the place justice.
