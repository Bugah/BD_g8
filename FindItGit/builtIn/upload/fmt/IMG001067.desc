Setting Sail
In a sort of tradition with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rawjrphotography/5317060628/in/photostream/">this photo</a> that I did at the new year last year, I wanted to make a picture to encourage everyone to take a big leap this year!  Set aside your fears and pursue whatever it is you’ve been dying to pursue!  Life begins with making great choices, and the best choice to make is pursuing your dreams!  I know my goal is to become a full time photographer by 2013!  So, HAPPY 2012, I hope all your celebrations are safe and exciting, as mine will be I’m guessing!  And thanks to my friends here for braving the cold!  We need snow here in Michigan to accompany the cold :O Although today is like 40 degrees... whats up Michigan weather?!
