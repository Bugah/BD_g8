A patch of Heaven
And there was i was looking at the glass water, enjoying the real life cinema of the fisherman at work. the clouds kept shifting, the light kept dropping to a softer and much smoother tone. the summer breeze was simply magical, few minutes later, i left my camera and jumped into the fresh, tasty, sweet rain filled watery heaven.
