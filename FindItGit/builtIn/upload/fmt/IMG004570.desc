OtouSan
A little something I brought back from Japan.

Otousan is a Mascot for the Softbank Cellular Carrier in Japan.

Otousan is a rare white Japanese dog named Shiroi. He has a human wife, a beautiful daughter who works at a Softbank shop,  and a black son who speaks with a foreign accent (American?).

He looks more like a bear in this portrait though.

If you squeeze the plushie, he says an encouraging line in his trademark deep Japanese samurai voice.
