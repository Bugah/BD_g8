Arriving to Shipwreck Beach Zakynthos
This is a photo taken when I was arriving at Shipwreck (Navagio) Beach.  Navagio is an isolated sandy cove on Zakynthos island and one of the most famous beaches in Greece. It is notable because it is home to the wreck of the alleged smuggler ship; thus, it is often referred to as 'Smugglers Cove'.  This strip of beach can ONLY be accessed by boat.  Truly a breathtaking experience.
