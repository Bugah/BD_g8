<i>As we drove home from walking around Hyde Park the other day, I spotted this leaf next to our driveway. It could soak in all the late evening light as the sun set in the distance.  This tree didn't keep many of its leaves through Winter, but a few survived.  In Spring, these leaves come out pink before eventually turning green.</i>
