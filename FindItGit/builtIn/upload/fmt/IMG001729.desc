you asked for it, so here it is 
regarding your mails I will show you the combination Panasonic Lumix GX1 paired with Leica R Apo-Elmarit 2,8/100 via Novoflex LER-Adapter. Also the new electronic finder LVF2 is mounted on the cam. 
If you want to see pics made with this combo please take a look at my &quot;Konica Hexar Limited&quot; pictures just before.
