Generally, I am not at all lazy in case of photography but that evening I was. I didn't even bothered to open tripod to get long exposure on water instead took simple handheld shots. I was amused by this kind of sunset which is not so common in Singapore. While my companion <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/reggiewan">Reggie</a> was busy hunting all the best possible angle on <b>Punggol Beach</b>;)
