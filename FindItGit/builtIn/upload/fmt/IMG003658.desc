Irish Guards' Mascot
A very young member of the Irish Guards, pictured at Waterford Barracks with the regiment's mascot, an Irish Wolfhound.

I thought that the dog must have moved, because on zooming in, there seemed to be a ghostly leg, and some obvious remedial work on his tail. <b><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/limerick37/" target="_blank">James Guerin</a></b> explained this effect:
&quot;<i>I think the 'ghost' is the original position of the dog's tail and maybe this was too 'between it's legs' for the owner. Seems a bit bizarre to edit it but maybe this was a 2nd version and the owner ended up going for the original print as the edit was too obvious. </i>&quot;

Believe it or not, we now have a name for this dog. He was <i>Leitrim Boy</i>, out of Galtee Boy and Carlow Nora. Leitrim Boy was born on Tuesday, 12 November 1907, and so would have been 9
 years old when this photo was taken (or 63 in dog years!).

As was pointed out below by a few people, the Irish Guards were on the Western Front in 1917, but as <b><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33577523@N08/" target="_blank">ofarrl</a></b> said:
&quot;<i>I think the most likely explanation for the presence of the Irish Guards, or at least the band members, in Waterford would have been for the purposes of recruitment, they did a similar tour of Ireland in April 1915.</i>&quot;

Date: Wednesday, 21 February 1917
