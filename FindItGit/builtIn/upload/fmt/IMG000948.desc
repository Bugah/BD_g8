Kilchurn castle, Scotland highlands
Not often appreciated today is that when built, <b>Kilchurn</b> was on a small island in <b>Loch Awe</b> scarcely larger than the castle itself.  Most sources suggest it was accessed via an <b>underwater or low lying causeway</b>: you only have to look at the castle today to see that when water levels were lowered by clearance of the loch's outflow in 1817, they didn't drop by far.
<b>Kilchurn Castle</b> was built in about 1450 by <b>Sir Colin Campbell</b>, first <b>Lord of Glenorchy</b>, and it started life as a five storey tower house with a courtyard defended by an outer wall. By about 1500 an additional range and a hall had been added to the south side of the castle. Further buildings went up during the 1500s and 1600s.
<b>Kilchurn's</b> development started to take an unusual turn in 1681. In that year, <b>Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy</b> was made first <b>Earl of Breadalbane</b>. To this end he spent much of the 1690s converting <b>Kilchurn Castle</b> into a modern barracks capable of housing 200 troops. This saw the addition of a three storey L-shaped block along the north side of the castle.
The Castle was used as a Government garrison during the 1715 and 1745 <b>Jacobite Rebellions</b>: but the family's efforts to sell it to the Government were unsuccessful. They left in 1740 and moved to <b>Taymouth Castle</b> in eastern Scotland, to spend their time developing their Perthshire estates. <b>In 1760 the castle was badly damaged by lightning</b> and was completely abandoned. It is now in the care of <b>Historic Scotland</b>.
