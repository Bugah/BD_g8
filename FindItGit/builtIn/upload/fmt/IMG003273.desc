Darn...No Parking...Again!
This always happens...no parking at the beach.  But that's okay...the most important part was that I enjoyed Veteran's Day at the beach with my wife and son.  It's always a great pleasure to spend time with my family!

I've been Missing In Action for a while in Flickr Land and I have a lot of catch up to do with my friends and contacts...so please excuse me :-)
