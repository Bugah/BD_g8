Trafalgar Square, London. Night light
<b>Â© All rights reserved. </b>
As you know I am not a fan of 'portrait' views but this is a difficult shot to take when using a landscape view... however, Trafalgar Square -  close to traffic and let the long exposure do it trick..  here's the result - a very patriotic red, white &amp; blue image - the colours of the Union flag.
Photo taken on a meet-up with a long time Flickr friend of mine, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/21273239@N04/">Rose</a>.
