Acting With a Dollhouse
One of my Aunt Ida Bailey photos from her showbizz days. The Ida Bailey Shop was business that she started after she quit performing in Hollywood and stage. Bad timing on her part it was just before the 1929 stock market crash. It was all clothing designed and made by her. She did well with her Hollywood friends, but she could not survive the crash. Coleen Moore was a very well known actress of the time. She would retire not too far into the sound movie era. Her next passion would be making fantastic dollhouses.
