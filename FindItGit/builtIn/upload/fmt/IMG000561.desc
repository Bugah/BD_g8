The Doctor explores the alien ship...
I have covetted this damn playset for years and today it arrived. Nemo's Cabin Control playset, from Mezco's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea line. It is the most maleable set with a modular construction and around 20 accessories, many of which can be used on other sets and dioramas.

The flooring lends itself to great mood lighting but to be honest I was only messing around today. Think Bespin Carbon Freeze Chamber.
