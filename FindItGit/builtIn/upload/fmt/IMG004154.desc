NYMR LMS Class 5 45212 Beckhole.
This shot was taken back in April 2007 during the East Coast Motive Power 50 year gala on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.At that time I had a lineside pass so was able to get shots like this at Beckhole.I clearly remember the sound on the approach and the steady climb towards the camera. LMS Stanier class 5MT 45212 makes a stirring sight on a lovely sunny Saturday.
