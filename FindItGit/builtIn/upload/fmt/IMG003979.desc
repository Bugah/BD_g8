Got Any Blacker
New minolta slr, wanted to run a film through it. So feeling like a real hipster (with an old slr I got off ebay), I organized all my stuff neatly on my floor and took a snap of it. It's so cliche but i guess it's cliche'd cos it works. Would love some film for those polaroid cameras again.
