<b>LOOK FOR THEIR MUSIC VIDEO ON MTV!</b>

this was a really short notice shoot, day before put together. so no concept or real time to find a back ground, so we shot in three different places all located near ethan and sarah's house. one was a gas station, another in front of ethans house and another spot on the gas station. we shot at 9 p.m. so i was at a major disadvantage not having an interesting back ground and shooting at night. sarah and our friend robert helped big time holding and lights and with setup/breakdown with out them shoot woulda taken about 4 hours instead of 2 so big big thanks.

***all locations were in pitch black no ambient light settings so take that into consideration before commenting ***
