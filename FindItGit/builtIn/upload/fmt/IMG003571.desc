Koh Phi Phi Leh, Thailand
Phi Phi Leh is an uninhabited island whose natural beauty is still unspoiled. The island is mostly composed of towering limestone cliffs that spring up at right angles with the blue water surface. The water is brightly turquoise with the abundant coral reefs and species of fish. There are several magnificent beaches and scenic islands standing offshore. There is no accommodation on Phi Phi Leh, as most of the island is composed of sheer cliffs and small lagoons with teeming fish. Trips leave every day for sightseeing and snorkelling, especially good for beginners as the water is warm, absolutely clear, and shallow.
