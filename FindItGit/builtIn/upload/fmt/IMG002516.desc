Love should grow...........
.................. like a wild iris in the fields, unexpected, after a terrible storm, opening a purple mouth to the rain, with not a thought to the future, ignorant of the grass and the graveyard of leaves around, forgetting its own beginning. 
Love should grow like a wild iris but does not.&quot;
