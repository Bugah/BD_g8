Street Light - Colour Charting!
After the success of my last upload I had to call this one Colour Charting.  A big thanks for all the comments and faves.  I still do not understand what makes a good explore placing.  I prefer this one myself, ah well lets see what happens.

Taken opposite the Arc de Triomphe on the Avenue des Champs Elys√©es.
