Downpour
This was taken right outside where <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bellydnce1103/sets/72157624829599862">this house</a> used to be. The house burnt down sometime last year, but the barn burnt down just yesterday. They wouldn't let us get any closer to the location. But this is the emotion I was feeling at the time, so it's what came to mind, although any kind of story could be behind this.
