Vancouver in Violet
Here is a view of Yaletown, a very trendy district of Vancouver, from Granville Bridge.  This image was taken shortly after the conclusion of the Celebration of Light festival.  The sky had transformed into this incredible hue of violets and purples.  At the same time, it was a pleasure to see what almost resembled a race of boats leaving English Bay and making their way back under the bridges to their respective docks long False Creek.  There were dozens upon dozens of boats, like a parade on water.
