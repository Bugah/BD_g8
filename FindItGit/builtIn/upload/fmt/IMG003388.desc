Hands too fast
Igor, the one jumping higher, is another dear friend, he is such a darling. But he has abandonned me, his family, girlfriend and friends, like so many others, he's gone to Japan, to work for 5 years, gather money, come back to Brazil, open his own business and hopefully have a comfortable life. 
Nowadays it's really hard to get a job in Brazil, and most pay shameful low salaries.

I really miss those afternoons when lots of my friends used to go to Zerão to play basketball (actually, I would go there to watch only hahahah I'm such a lousy shot!)

And featuring a really nice stream, there's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andifoto/">Andi</a>, he's a model/fashion photographer, really worth paying a visit

Igordão, saudades mizifi! Some não!
