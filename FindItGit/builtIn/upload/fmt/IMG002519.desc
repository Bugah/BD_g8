I am a day late but still Happy Birthday to my dear sister <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50034763@N00">Lall</a>. She is on her annual birthday trip with friends. She texted that it was raining the whole day yesterday in Italy. Hey I will take a day of rain in Italy anytime. Never been there!
