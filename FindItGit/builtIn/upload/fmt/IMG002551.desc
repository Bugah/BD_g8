The Shining twin girls
This former coal factory, located in the west-south of France, closed in 1997 when the coal stopped being extracted in the area. Since, this big steelwork is abandoned. It has been seeting to fire several times, and recently in October 2011.

The mayor of the city and the factory owner deliver a judgment dealing with the ban of accessing this place, but the activity is still there (paintball/airsoft players, photographs, taggers, visitors...)
