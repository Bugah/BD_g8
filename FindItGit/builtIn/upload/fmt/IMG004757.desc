7/52 - ghosts in the night {life on pause}
I wasn't intending this to become a mini series but I don't have a lot of choice. Emily is so busy, she is stressed, she is working hard, she has gone away for a while into her head. I miss her. Her course will be worth it the long run. We are having to have dates nights just because we wont see each otherwise. 

Do you and your {insert here} ever have date nights?
