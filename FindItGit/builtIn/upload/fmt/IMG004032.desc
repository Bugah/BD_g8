Bag
I wanted to do one of these for ages, but never got around to it. So, finally.. here it is. 
The things this picture tells:

- Green is my favourite colour.
- I'm learning Dutch this semester.
- I don't care about smartphones or whatsoever.
- I can knit (a little bit).
- I sometimes run around with dirt spatters on my back (and bag), because I'm too lazy and too miserly to buy a mudgard for my bike.
