Winter is not so bad...

It's amazing how the light plays the role in photography. I love the colors on this one, and I did just almost no post-processing of the image after I took it.

This and the previous shot are taken with the 50mmf1.8, which is surprisingly sharp. Even when it's not macro, I can get so close.
