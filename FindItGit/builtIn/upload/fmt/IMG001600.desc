Boy Dancing Capoeira On The Beach, Angola
Kids and teens come to the beach in Namibe, on the coast,  to train at Capoeira. Great time to make pictures of them, even if the 10 kids all wanted to be on every picture at the same time! They jump, dance, fight, in a very happy mood. But..they don't go to school...
