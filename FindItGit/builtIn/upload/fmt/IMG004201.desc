91/100 Kadeeja (Explored)
I spotted Kadeeja walking towards me and loved her clothing, especially the headscarf (having never photographed anyone in a headscarf yet) and the look of the tasty ice cream she was eating (pictured but not included).  

I approached her and he kindly listened to me before agreeing to be in the project.  Kadeeja is a student (can't read my scribble to see what she was studying modern something - maybe art?) and as we parted I asked her what she was listening to, she looked at me cooly and replied &quot;a song&quot;!

Thanks Kadeeja for your willingness to participate!
