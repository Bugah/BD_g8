Who needs a head...?
...when you've got a fab frock and a baby kangaroo!

Beautiful knitted dress made by grannygreen, who had just opened a new Etsy shop (grannygreen.etsy.com). See how fine the knitting is- every Blythe needs a granny like this! Now all I need is a full-size dress for me :)  Thanks Sandra!

Kip the kangaroo made by me.
