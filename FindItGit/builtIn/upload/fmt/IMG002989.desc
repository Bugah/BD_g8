This is my favorite picture (<i>of mine, that is</i>). Being here in Florida, I'm reminded of the old days in photo-school when I had lots of time on my hands ... and owned this bike ... and had plenty of crazy friends to stick in front of the camera. I'm in Florida to attend my friend Rachel's wedding, she did the makeup on this particular shoot.
I like to pair the photo above with this one: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/synthetic/24523784/in/set-790209/">www.flickr.com/photos/synthetic/24523784/in/set-790209/</a>
Check out my <i>my favorites</i> set for more of those pics.
