The seaside at Napoli just keeps <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/5530243384/">giving</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/5532638767/">giving</a> when it comes to photographs!

After going up all around the hills of Napoli looking for a good place to catch the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/5524658747/">sunset</a>, Sara said we should go down to the rocks and see the sun set behind the horizon. Once we got there, it was blantantly apparent to me that the sun sets behind that big hill you can see on the right of the photograph, so we abandoned that plan and headed back up the hills.

Before we did so, I thought we'd spend fifteen or so minutes around this area, as the light tone was lovely, it was filled with people and we'd already climbed up some big rocks. As soon as I saw this couple lying at the water's edge, with the vast expanse of gorgeous bay stretching out behind them, I knew this would be a great photo for my 10-20mm.
