Fokker E.XIII Monospaceplane
This is an upgrade of the previous E.XII model with a stronger World War II influence.

The wings are set lower and further back on the fuselage, and the front landing gears can now fold away under the wings. The cockpit is now fully enclosed and there is more detailing on the engine section.

The propeller is meant for atmospheric operations. The E.XII model used to have one, too, but I had removed that to make the photo editing job for the dogfight pictures a bit easier. It doesn't look like it in this picture, but there is enough ground clearance for the propeller to spin freely while the plane is on the ground.

This is going to be the last 2010 MOC from me. Happy New Year, everyone!
