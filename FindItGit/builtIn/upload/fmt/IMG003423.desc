The Mursi (or Murzu) are a Sub-Saharan African nomadic cattle herder tribe located in the Debub Omo Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region in Ethiopia, close to the Sudanese border. The estimated population of the Mursi is around 3900.
Surrounded by mountains between the Omo River and its tributary the Nino, the home of the Mursi is one of the most isolated region of the country. Their neighbors include the Bodi, the Aari, the Banna, the Kara, the Nyangatom and the Surma.
The Mursi have their own language, also called Mursi. Few are familiar with Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, and their literacy level is very low.
The religion of the Mursi tribe is classified as Animism, although about 15% are Christians.
The Mursi women are famous for wearing plates in their lower lips. These lip discs are made of clay. Girls are pierced at the age of 15 or 16. Similar body ornaments are worn by the Suy√° people, a Brazilian tribe.
