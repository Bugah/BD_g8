What about Prometheus...? I feel betrayed.After all years they came with this?No so bad,but could be better.There are some stupid parts and bad acting,visualy great. No just killing game ,more about exploration and origin.Take look here-impressive discussions .
Thanks for comments and faves.Have a grand weekend!
