Someone needs a little bit of motivation
For those who don't have a clue what's going on in Belgium, here is some information before I explain the creation: soon we'll be the world champion of forming a government. Bart de Wever was elected, and I'm sure he tries his best, but the various parties don't want to compromise and just aren't able to make an agreement and form a government. There also have been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/world/europe/24belgium.html" rel="nofollow">a couple of protests</a>. 

In my creation the Belgian citizens are sitting in a chariot in the form of <a href="http://www.kalmthout.be/77848.img?width=250" rel="nofollow">a box of <s>French</s> Belgian fries</a>. Some people are angry at the politicians, other can laugh with the situation and are searching for positive sides of it. Hauling the chariot is <a href="http://cdn70.ne.be/librairy/people/1630/7059.jpg" rel="nofollow">Bart de Wever</a>, the one supposed to be forming a government. It's been going on so long now, he sure could use a little bit of motivation. We Belgian know what he loves, so we use that: a burger. Let's hope it works so he can form a government fast enough because in twelve days we'll be <a href="http://lerecorddumonde.be/" rel="nofollow">world champion</a>!
