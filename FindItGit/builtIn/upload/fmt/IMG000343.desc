Disney - The World Cried...
...the day Walt died.  This piece of art, which is a newspaper print, was featured in many newspapers across the country the day after Walter E. Disney died, December 16, 1966.

This is actually a photo I took of the newspaper print, which is displayed in the attraction &quot;Walt Disney: One Man's Dream&quot; at Disney's Hollywood Studios of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.
