Curvy
The walkway in the American Hangar at Duxford Air Museum.  I was going to upload as a square but have left it wide as I think it really accentuates that bottom curve.

The Flickr headaches continue; a new observation; all my 'older' (pre Flickr update) shots look noticably soft at all sizes unless you view in lightbox and they then appear nice and sharp?  The ones uploaded since the change seem to be okay unless I resize the browser and force it to an inbetween size.  I checked a few of your streams and it seems the same for all.  Can anyone confirm?  How annoying!

Please view in lightbox as I think the black background really gives it some punch.

Have a great weekend and enjoy the Jubilee! :-)
