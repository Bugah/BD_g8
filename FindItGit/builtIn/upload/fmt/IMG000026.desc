Happy Halloween 2011
Happy Halloween from Disneyland.  I would have liked to post this earlier, but I was just too tired to finish processing last night.  I stayed after the park closed for my first time to take photos.  It was a lot of fun and I think I got some great shots, I still haven't loaded all the images to Lightroom but I'm excited to see what I got.
