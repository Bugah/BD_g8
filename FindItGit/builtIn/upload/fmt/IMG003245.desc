wishing on a star
I'm wishing for a year filled with peace, love, happiness...
macro shot of a datura blossom as it unfurls... the yellow in the center is the color of the petals before they turn white... I love the morning dew drops clinging to the tops of the petals. My alternate title was &quot;Jimson Weed Ã  la Georgia O'Keeffe&quot;

The only post production was to crop my original photo.
Please view larger to see some amazing details: <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=2155598855&amp;size=large">View On Black</a> and if you have the time... view the original size...
Thank you for all the views, faves, invitations, and comments!
