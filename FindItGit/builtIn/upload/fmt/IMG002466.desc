A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words.
<i><b>&quot; If you’re alone, I’ll be your shadow.
If you want to cry, I’ll be your shoulder.
If you want a hug, I’ll be your pillow.
If you need to be happy, I’ll be your smile.
But anytime you need a friend, I’ll just be ME. &quot;
