Sint-Anna-Tunnel
The river Scheldt divides the city of Antwerp in two major parts. On the right bank you have the old city center and the old harbor and across the river the newly developed <i>Linkeroever</i> or Left Bank. You can take the underground tram or you can walk via this pedestrian tunnel. It's about a 10 minutes walk beneath the Scheldt.
