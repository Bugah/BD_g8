Then It Rained
I was trying to build a mini Barbie City earlier this afternoon. So, I decided to bring my playsets and dollies in the garden for a more realistic feel. The sun was really nice but a few minutes after I have set up some of the playsets, it began to drizzle. I had to dash and put all my playsets inside the house again... :( Mission failed. I'll try my luck again next time. Maybe around summer...
