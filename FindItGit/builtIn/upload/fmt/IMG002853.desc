Sunset at Panther Beach
The sun had just disappeared under the horizon, and  huge waves were crashing violently against the rocks as I set up to take this shot.  It was truly an exciting time for me as that I've wanted to shoot this picture ever since seeing Jim Patterson's and Steve Landeros' (Maxxsmart) fantastic images from this same place.

Many thanks also go out to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeoria/">  Mike, </a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43493187@N04/">  Miguel, </a> who kept me focused on getting back to this area after our first visit two short weeks ago.  I might have bowed out otherwise.

This image shows the reasons I got into photographyâ€¦ to show to others the wonderful beauty of our earth and to also create surreal images that take the viewer to somewhere magical.
