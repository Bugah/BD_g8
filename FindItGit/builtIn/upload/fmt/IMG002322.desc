Rosa, English rose, 'Crown Princess Margarethe'
One of my favourites!! Lovely colour and quite a lot of flowers with nice strong scent. Has survived 3 winters here in Sweden, so it's quite hardy. The bush is quite small and the shape is not all that good, but the flowers make up for it! I have to tie it up since it gets so many heavy flowers.

FRIDAY FLOWER POWER!!!!!
