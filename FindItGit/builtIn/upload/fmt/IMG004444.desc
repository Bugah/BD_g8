A little promo for NASA today. This is Mars. Victoria crater. A piece of a huge panorama comprising dozens of shots taken by the Mars Rover Opportunity. I upsampled the large jpeg file provided by NASA and tonemapped it with Photomatix, then worked on exposure and dynamic range with Topaz Adjust. I think the tonemapping on the rock worked out ok (see large), but the sky pixelated when I uploaded it. Not sure what happened there.

See the original panoramas and explore some amazing photography: <a href="http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/panoramas/opportunity/">NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell</a>
