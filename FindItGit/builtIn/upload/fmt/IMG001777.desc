363/365 | Nearing The End...
As the year quickly comes to a close, I am reminded of my photographic adventure that is nearly complete.  I set out to take a photograph, edit that photograph and post that photograph to the web on a daily basis.  For good measure, I even decided to do a second daily project of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/egerbver/sets/72157625635497123/with/6592231685/">Alternatives</a>; in hindsight, perhaps a little too ambitious.  

I began by posting my photos to my Flickr account but soon added a Tumblr and Twitter account as well as an RSS and Email feed and finally on Day 100, I added my website; <a href="http://www.365DaysofClones.com" rel="nofollow">www.365DaysofClones.com</a>.

Today is <a href="http://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/tick-tock-day/" rel="nofollow">Tick Tock Day</a>.  Tick Tock Day is all about looking back upon your year to ensure that you have achieved your goals.  I can honestly say that as far as my photographic goals go for the year 2011, I have met and exceeded them!  

But where does that leave me for the upcoming year?  Where will I go from here?  The short answer is youâ€™ll just have to wait and see!

In preparation for the upcoming year and my next photo project, I have decided to create a <a href="http://facebook.com/egerbver" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> page.

Please feel free to continue to follow my progress on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/egerbver">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://egerbver.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/egerbver" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ContentFrom365DaysOfClones" rel="nofollow">RSS</a> or <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=ContentFrom365DaysOfClones&amp;loc=en_US" rel="nofollow">Email</a>; but if you are so inclined, you may now follow my current as well as my future project for the 2012 year on <a href="http://facebook.com/egerbver" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a>.

Enjoy!
