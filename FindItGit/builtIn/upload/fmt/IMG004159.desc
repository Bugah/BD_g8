coming storm, buena vista, co
I sketched this on our side porch as a storm brewed.  As a matter of fact, I had to move inside to finish because it moved in quickly and started blowing my stuff all over.

This was actually a real &quot;sketch&quot;, compared to my usual 1-2 hour drawings (can you really call them &quot;sketches&quot; if they take that long?).  I think I spent a total of about a half hour on it.
