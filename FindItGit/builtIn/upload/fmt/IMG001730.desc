net men
These young men are bringing in a haul of fish by using a fishing net from the shore. Several other young men go approximately 300 meters into the pounding surf to bring the line up and then men in relays lift it and bring it ashore. As you can see from the three people on the lower right it is very hard work. They caught a huge haul that included a bonita, a squid, and a very angry snake.
