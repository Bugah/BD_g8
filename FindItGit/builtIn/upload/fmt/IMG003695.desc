Starfighter.
By chance I met my friend Jakob. He told me that a Lamborghini Murciélago LP670-4 SuperVeloce and a Reiter Lamborghini Gallardo stand in the parking garage of the Maximilianstraße. Many thanks to him!! So we went in and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the huge wing. It was my first time to see a SuperVeloce, so I was very exited. This is number 50 of 350, so a special number.
