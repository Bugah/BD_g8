Trey Ratcliff took an amazing amount of time out of his schedule to wander around Westminster and the South Bank with anyone who wanted to tag along and join in.

Not worried about climbing on walls, ballustrades and buildings, he was happy to pass on some of his tips and his technique to everyone that came.

He made a point of saying hello to everyone and encouraging us all to ask him questions as strolled through London.
