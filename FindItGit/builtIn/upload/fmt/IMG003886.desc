year end...what was in my bag...
it's almost the end of the year. Before heading out today, i was ready to file away my 2011 travelers notebook &amp; planner. Stamping and card writings are both big part of the year &amp; they are well-suited for my 2011 TN covers.
The planner on the left was a collage print of the stamps i received this year. it covers front and back of the TN.The journal on the right has mostly Canadian stamps that i like.
