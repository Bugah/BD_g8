15/52 - Celebrate
Joined the group <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ptm52/">Paint the Moon - Let;s Do 52</a> to keep me focused on taking and uploading a pic a week. The theme this week is &quot;Celebrate&quot;, alternative theme is &quot;Minimal&quot;. 

Go on lift up your mugs, you dont need a reason or much to celebrate :).

Thanks for the comments and visits and have a great Thursday.
