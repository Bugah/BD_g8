Santa Monica Promenade
One more shot from LA Tour.  Took lot of shots (especially sunsets) but not sure I have anything that good from the tour. This shot was mostly an experiment just trying something out while I was there. It's a 3 shot HDR but its not too different from the original. It's an Ok shot but since I processed it, thought I might as well post it.
