Ahoy ! Beautiful Skies Ahead
Grandstand view for the Captain as he stares straight ahead guiding his big houseboat locally referred to as a &quot;kettuvallam&quot;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettuvallam">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettuvallam</a> through the waterways of Alleppey.

The kettuvallams start from Alleppey which is about 60kms from Cochin. 

Alleppey now is the hub for backwaters tourism in Kerala. House boats locally called &quot;kettuvallam&quot; are available on hire on a daily basis as well as for longer duration to take visitors on the old waterways. These house boats in general have 2 bed rooms and attached bath rooms. Some of the boats have the bedrooms fitted with airconditioners. A routine trip includes food cooked on board in the traditional Kuttanad style. The leisurly cruises show a microcosm of life on the water side with breath taking views of the water, land, birds and human habitations.
