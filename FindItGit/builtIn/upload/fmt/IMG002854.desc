Strategic Pursuer Mk II
Using Tromas' excellent <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48553964@N04/5896980433/in/photostream">AD-Rock</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48553964@N04/5911735802/in/photostream/">IC-3 Goat Mk II</a> as a starting point, I gave the old evolved treatment to one of my favorite sets as a kid, <a href="http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6848-3" rel="nofollow">6848 Strategic Pursuer</a>.

I've been wanting to do this one for a long, long time, but I felt like I needed to get some other things out of the way first.

Having done that, this was so much fun to build.

I always imagined the Strategic Pursuer as having the ability to jump long distances, hence why this has reverse joints and little jump jets.

Obviously inspired by the greatest chicken-leg walkers of all time, the ED-209 and the Madcat Omnimech.
