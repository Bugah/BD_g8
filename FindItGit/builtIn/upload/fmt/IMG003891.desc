Balloon shooting on the beach!
I got this shot in marina beach, chennai.

Marina Beach is a beach in the city of Chennai, India, along the Bay of Bengal, part of the Indian Ocean. The beach runs from near Fort St. George in the north to Besant Nagar in the south, a distance of about 12 km. Marina is the considered to be the second longest beach in the world. The Marina is primarily sandy, unlike the short, rocky formations that make up the Juhu Beach in Mumbai on the west coast of India
