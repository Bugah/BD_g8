Final 20 of Countryfile Photographic competition
There has just been a great deal of excitement in the Hulance household as we were watching the judging of the &quot;countryfile Photographic Competition&quot;. The 56,000 entries had been whittled down to the final 20 in each of the twelve categories and to our amazement this shot was on the top of the pile in the Landscape category. Although it wasn't chosen I was chuffed to see it in the final 20.

For those overseas flickrbuddies - Countryfile is a national UK TV programme on the BBC about life in the UK Countryside and every year viewers are invited to send in their photos to be included in a calendar which is sold with the proceeds going to charity (children in need).
