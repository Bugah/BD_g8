Lucky Strike of Lightning {Explore}
Location: 35th Floor of Column Bangkok.  

Thanks for helping make it to Explore :) 

There is curfew here from 11pm to 4am which is expected to last until the end of this week. 

This was a lucky shot!!  No tripod, no gadgets.  I was just messing around with my camera taking some shots of the night view of the city on a rainy night and this bit of lightning came my way :)  

Wishing you all too one of the moments of lightning this week :)
