Our Small Palace...
... another survivor of the real state speculation while almost all the others had been knocked down for the construction of new buildings... Contructed in 1922 in french neoclassic style, it served of residence for 80 years. Today, surrounded of building, it functions as a particular cultural center called House of Art and Culture Julieta de Serpa, a homage to the mother of the current proprietor. The mansion also has some luxurious restaurants with sofisticated food! Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
