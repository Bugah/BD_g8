Emma's school project goes horribly wrong when Daddy mis-understands "I want you to meet my school frog"
Hmmmmmm Frog legs, our time in Paris was not wasted.

This was so much fun, Emma and I went out exploring today and we discussed this shot in the car, so to come home and do it was great. Talk about pulling off the look I asked her to do! What a ham!

Happy Monday everyone.

Stobist attempt: 430Ex at end of table at full power into a silver umbrella.
