LL-563 Tigershark
I put this together Friday during Zoe's nap after I saw <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainbikerider/6966694461/in/contacts/">Stefan's latest</a>.  I was trying to get something in his style, but just couldn't pull it off.

Anyway, it gave me a chance to try out those hinges in preparation for another MOC I'm working on, and to let you guys know I'm not dead or anything and still love teh space ships and lazors.
