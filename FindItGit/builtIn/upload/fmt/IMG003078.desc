Beneath the golden arch (not it's not an advertisement for McDonalds :p)
Another milky way panorama I took on a recent holiday to Tenerife. Taken at the foot of Mt Teide again, the skies there are almost perfect for night photography. This is a stitch from 3 seperate images as my 14-24 isn't wide enough to catch the whole arch in one shot.
