Welcome, Welcome, Welcome
This is my absolute favorite scene of the Park Opening Show.  It looks so much cooler in person as they all slowly move their arms.  No picture can really do it justice. 

I should be posting 3-5 pictures daily until I get the trip report posted.  Not only do I need to get images ready for that, but I also just realized that I'll be going back to posting Christmas pictures from last year's trip in about a month (yes, much like Disney and Walmart, Christmas in my household starts before Thanksgiving.  How the heck do you celebrate Thanksgiving, anyway?  Hang dead turkeys all over the house?  Christmas kicks too much ass to only be celebrated for less than a month).  I had better get those Halloween pictures posted now!

It contains many pictures of us as well as many &quot;Flickr-type&quot; pictures that will probably never make it over here.  Thanks for reading/viewing!
