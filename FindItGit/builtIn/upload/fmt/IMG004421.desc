Sanity Calms But Madness Is More Interesting
We had these amazing winds blowing the roofs (well, almost) of our houses last night. The show lasted till the early hours of the morning, so I hardly got any sleep last night. I've been surviving on strong coffee today.

At one point it started raining vertical straight at the windows of our bedroom. It made one hell of a noise, by hitting the glass so fast it sounded like hail. I'm very tired right now, but I can't sleep, so I'll post this image of the Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra and I'll be off to bed later. Apparently the show is set for a repeat tonight as well. 

Here is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stage88/3764793157/">another shot</a> taken only moments later at the same place as this one.
