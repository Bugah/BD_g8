French Market Patio
Disneyland is unique in many ways, but one of the things I really enjoy about Disneyland compared to most other theme parks I've been to is the food.  They don't have great food compared to some of my favorite restaurants, but compared to every other Theme Park I can think of Disneyland has much better food.  I'm rarely disappointed after eating a meal in the park.  The French Market is one of my favorite spots in Disneyland, along with Rancho del Zocalo and of course the Blue Bayou.
