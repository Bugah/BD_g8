One of the rollerbladers last night in the Grand Palais, doing a grind on a metallic railing .  No special effects here, this is straight out of the camera :-)

If you look closely (easier with large size), you can see the 2 dark silhouettes of the skater still jumping onto the rail a moment before, and sliding a moment after. I'm not sure what caused this, might be a combination of my own flash and someone's else on the other side I think ?
