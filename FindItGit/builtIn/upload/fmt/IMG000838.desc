Pompeii and Mount Vesuvius by morning
My hotel room in Naples faced out across the bay of Napoli and Mount Vesuvius, where I could see the sunrise each morning. I always kept my camera charged up just in case there was one of these mornings, and fortunately, there always was. I canâ€™t believe my friend Valerio (Valpopando) actually lives there and gets to see this all the time. I hope he appreciates it!
