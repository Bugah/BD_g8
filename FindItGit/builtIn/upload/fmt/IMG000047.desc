Buckingham Palace - London
<b>Â© All rights reserved. </b>
Buck Pal as we like to call it. It was a lovely night last night and I took the camera on a little outing to St James's Park .. got this one just before the sun disappeared behind the trees in Green Park. I know this is a little sugary but it's nice to get some tourist shots of the city you live in :)
