Summer Lights

I stood out on my front porch for about 45 minutes taking pictures of the lightning. This one was my favorite from the batch. This is also my first attempt at taking pictures of lighting- mostly a lot of waiting.

It was awesome to watch the sky light up and see how huge the bolts were tonight.

Also, if you have not, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kristibogelphotography/2737602356/">take a look at my self-portrait as well from tonight</a>.
