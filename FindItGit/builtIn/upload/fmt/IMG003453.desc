This was the longest exposure I could get with my K800i cameraphone. Click here <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnieb/453048308/">www.flickr.com/photos/johnnieb/453048308/</a> to see what a proper camera achieved this night.

When shooting with the K800i at night you need to use Image Stabilizer, but this really increases the Exposure time. To slow is right down, I took off Image Stabilizer. Only problem is you need the worlds steadiest hand! This one came out pretty good.
