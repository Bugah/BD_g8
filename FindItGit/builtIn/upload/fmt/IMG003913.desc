2010_05_31 Min zentangle - seaweed
When they say 'finish your zentangle in one sitting' ... they really don't mean 9 weeks, do they :-)

I realised today that the reason I'm struggling to work on the really BIG zentangle I'm doing, is because I had this one sitting neglected and unfinished in my folder.
