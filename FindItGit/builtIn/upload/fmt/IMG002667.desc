♫ Wherever I lay my hat, that's my home ♫

Lyrics, courtesy of Marvin Gaye

♫ By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry. 
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears 
for I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam,
wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
I'm telling you that's my home ♫
