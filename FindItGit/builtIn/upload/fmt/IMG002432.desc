An awe inspiring view from a top Makapu'u Point 647 feet above the sea. Overlooking the 63-acre (25 ha) offshore tuff cone Manana (or Rabbit Island) ,the low volcanic islet Kāohikaipu (Turtle Island), and the Mokulua Islands all bird sancuarys. The glistening blue ocean offers a majestic contrast to the green and lush Koolau mountains off in the distance.

Hawaiian legends tell of a supernatural being that arrived on Oahu from Tahiti and made this rocky prominence her home. Her name was Makapu'u, which means &quot;bulging eye,'' a reference to the eight bright eyes appearing on her face.
