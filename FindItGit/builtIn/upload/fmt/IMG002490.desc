View from Bella Orcheta over the Embalse
In southern Spain  only 20 km from  the bustling town of Benidorm/Costa Blanca  we find beautiful areas with orange trees  and roses full in blossom in November. The dam embalse collects waters from the rivers Amadorio and Sella from almost 1600 m down to the Mediterraneum which is some 6 km from the vistapoint.
