Andromeda Galaxy (EXPLORED)
Image Acquisition by Jim Misti and Steve Mazlin

I've been starved of clear nights for a while, the first really clear good one for ages was last night and I'm at the other end of the country from all my gear.

So I've been playing with Jim &amp; Steves fits files from their website <a href="http://www.mistisoftware.com/astronomy/index_fits.htm" rel="nofollow">www.mistisoftware.com/astronomy/index_fits.htm</a>

Jim has a nice selection of calibrated &amp; registered image files for you to combine and process.
