U.S. Army CAD
<i>The U.S. Army Combat Assistance Drone (CAD) is a small little bot armed with two 78mm AT rockets and an under-slung 7.62mm anti-infantry machine gun.  These little walkers were used in urban warfare to aid U.S. soldiers when going up against heavier armored units and outnumbering enemy infantry.  Despite the heavy armor covering such weak points as the legs and the thick armor in the rear, this combat drone can be hindered by grenades thrown under its hull or direct small arms fire to its external targeting system which acts as the eyes for its pilot.  </i>

In the picture it looks kind of meh.  I am not too crazy about the upper portion of the legs and the rear needs work.  This is my first try at a think tank style mech and I am not 100% sure how much I like it.  I think I have potential but need a lot of refinement.  I might also experiment with hardsuits too, but please give me your advice and criticism, I need it!
