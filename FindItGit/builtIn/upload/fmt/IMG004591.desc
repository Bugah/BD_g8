HTC TyTN II
My HTC TyTN II or Kaiser (not the strip down version called the AT&amp;T Tilt).  Had it for about 5 months now.  This is a phone only a geek would love, anyone else probably should stay away from it.  I have a love, hate relationship with this phone but I still much prefer it over the iPhone, thank you very much.

Strobist: One Nikon SB-24 about a feet away behind my hand on low power triggered wirelessly, no other light source besides the flash, given that it was 2:52am my room was pitch black.
