I am giving away THREE photos of your choice in the size of 13 x 18 cm in my facebook group! 

In order to take part, all you have to do is upload the favorite shot YOU have ever taken to the wall of my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/CapPhotography" rel="nofollow">facebook group</a> and I mean the photo itself and not a link and you are in! :) 

The competition will be open until <u>December 10th</u> and I will choose the winners on my group page but also let you know here! The three winners can then choose their favorite photo from me! If you have any questions, write me a flickr mail!
