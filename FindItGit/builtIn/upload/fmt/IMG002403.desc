Yesterday, I took my lovely friend out to take some photos of her in what ended up being both of our first maternity shoot!

She just found out, after we'd already planned to take some photos of her just for fun, that she is pregnant with her first child! I'd had this photo in mind before but it took on some extra meaning, and I'm loving how it turned out.

Sliders were slid, but easily, as I used my own 'cafe latte' preset here :)
