Uncooperative Probably-Not-Albino Tree Frog
I don't think he's an albino tree frog, since his eyes aren't red.  But when resting on the light gray concrete patio floor, he was nearly invisible. Got a shot of him <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffk42/2186121103/">facing the other way</a> and then one as he <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffk42/2186911760/">made his escape</a>.
