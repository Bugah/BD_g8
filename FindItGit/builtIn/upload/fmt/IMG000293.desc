Breakfast time!
Another one of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zarozinia/"> Angi’s</a> ideas. Yellow yolky collision in an egg. I intentionally left the yolky mess dripping down around the egg, things do get messy when you’re dipping soilders into eggs normally :) 

Jessops 360AFD flash on 1/16th power with white diffuser from left, YN460 flashgun on 1/16th power with white diffuser from the right/front. Yellow milk solution dropped into whole milk in the hollowed out egg cup. 1/200 exposure, F16, ISO 100. A smaller DOF may have been nicer, but increasing the aperture made the background too apparent, I wanted a black-out in the background
