The third one in the 'Miss K'-set.  it's a bit different from my usual style, but I like it a lot.

Thanks to Judith Vantomme for her creative input regarding clothing, hair and poses.

This is the first time I used my new Sigma 70-200mm f/2.8 HSM Macro II lens. It took me a while to choose between the Nikon and the Sigma, but in the end, I bought the cheap one. So far, I have no regrets.
