THERE'S A HURRICANE COMING
Took this one at Wimbe beach, Pemba (northern Mozambique); there was a hurricane coming - expected to hit the coast five or six  hours later. As you can see, the atmosphere was tense... strong winds and the waves arriiving higher and higher.., the beach was evacuated and I had to return to the hotel
