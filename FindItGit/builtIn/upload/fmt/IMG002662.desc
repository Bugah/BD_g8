If only i could [Explore]
... i'd make this world a better place

Took this shoot in october this year when i was visiting my grandparents in Romania.

In fact i don't really like this flower-bokeh pictures because there are so much of them but i loved the light on this one. Processing inspired by this awesome photographer: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/swarmoeskerken/" target="_blank">Siebe</a>

Hope you like it!
