Ignition, Launch!
Single Raw HDR image of the Space Shuttle, Enterprise at the National Air and Space Museum in Virginia.

I was pretty much in awe when I saw the Space Shuttle, Enterprise. It has since been replaced by the Space Shuttle, Discovery but this gives me a great excuse to go back and discover, Discovery!

Processed using Photomatix. Applied Nik and Topaz software, sharpened and cropped, and used Noiseware in Photoshop.
