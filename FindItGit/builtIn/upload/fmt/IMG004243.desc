(The Art of) Listening
Be a good <b><i>listener.</b></i> Your ears will never get you in trouble. 

<b>Frank Tyger</b>



There are people who, instead of <b><i>listening</b></i> to what is being said to them, are already <b><i>listening</b></i> to what they are going to say themselves. 

<b>Albert Guinon</b><i>
(1863 - 1923) </i>
