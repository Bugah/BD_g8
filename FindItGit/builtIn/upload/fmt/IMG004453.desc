Max swimming alone in Railay beach,  Thailand.
June 2008.

Railay Beach (Thai: อ่าวไร่เลย์) is a small peninsula located between the city of Krabi and Ao Nang. Accessible only by boat due to the high limestone cliffs cutting off mainland access. These cliffs attract rock climbers from all over the world, but the area is also popular due to its beautiful beaches and quiet relaxing atmosphere. Accommodation ranges from inexpensive bungalows popular with backpackers and climbers, to the renowned jet-set resort of Rayavadee. The three main areas of Railay consist of West Railay, East Railay and Tonsai, with Tonsai catering more to climbers.


Railay beach was not severely hit by the tsunami of December 26, 2004.
