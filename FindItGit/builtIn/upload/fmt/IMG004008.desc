Electric Tattooed Octopus.
last week I went to Pepe &amp; Zuno Tattooing in Viareggio where my good friend Riccardo AKA Art of Sponge AKA Richard Headcheese tattooed me on my left arm. His work is amazing, I really dig his style and I can't wait to have the tattoo finished!
I also met Pepe &amp; Zuno, which are the guys who own the shop, and they are such great and funny fellows!

come on, take a look to their beautiful art here:
