Erg Chebbi desert, Morocco
Erg Chebbi (Arabic: عرق الشبي‎), in southeastern Morocco, is one of two Saharan ergs – large dunes formed by wind-blown sand – in the northwest African nation (the other is Erg Chigaga near M'hamid). Its distinctive forms reach up to 150 meters high, and comprise a composite erg 22 km long (north-south) and 5 km wide. The erg is located roughly 40 kilometers southeast of Erfoud. Merzouga, the local tourist center is located near the edge of the dunes, a popular tourist destination.

An erg (also sand sea or dune sea) is a broad, flat area of desert covered with wind-swept sand with little or no vegetative cover. The term takes its name from the Arabic word ʿarq (عرق), meaning &quot;dune field&quot;. Strictly speaking, an erg is defined as a desert area that contains more than 125 square kilometers of aeolian or wind-blown sand and where sand covers more than 20% of the surface. Smaller areas are known as dune fields.
