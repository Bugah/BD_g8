ROOOAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR...
This is the first shot of my upcoming series of animal portraits. Look forward to seeing at least eleven photos (including this one). You will get to see lions, bears, a sea lion, a camel, an ostrich and a watusi.

The original title of this image was &quot;HAPPY EASTERRRRRRRRRRR...&quot; because it was posted on Easter Day. However, now, after a few days, this title obviously has become obsolete.
