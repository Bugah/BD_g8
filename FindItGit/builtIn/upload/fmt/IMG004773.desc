Griffith Silver-Black on Copper through Wet Tissue
I've been experimenting with a patina by Griffith called Silver-Black (I believe I got it from <a href="https://www.riogrande.com/home/" target="NEW">Rio Grande</a>).

It's instantaneous and very deep black; I believe I'll try diluting it somehow but that seems a bit dangerous.  At any rate, I'm liking this look I've been getting by laying down tissue and getting it wet (with water), then painting the patina along the edges of the tissue and letting capillary action do the rest.

This time I used a colored tissue and I got these interesting little haloes, I might have to delve into that a little more, perhaps with more metallic tissues.

This is for the back of a deco book swap I'm about to send off.
