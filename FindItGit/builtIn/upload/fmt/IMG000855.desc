Sailing on the Calm sea
On the calm wind day over the Gulf of Thailand, I enjoyed sitting on the lovely cafe over the cliff cape of Lamai Beach, Samui island. Smooth wind, cold fruit punch, beautiful seascape, one good book and my travel notebook.. One fine day and last moment before leaving Samui, island-- My last year trip
