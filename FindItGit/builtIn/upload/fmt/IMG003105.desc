My Twelfth Flower Of Spring, Vibrant Orange, White, And Yellow Daffodils!
Another beautiful set of flowers from that person in my neighborhood who was kind enough to let me photograph their beautiful front lawn garden today, these vibrant orange, yellow and white blossoms were very lush, striking, and beautiful!

As always, any identification help is greatly appreciated!                          

Oh, and also, note the tiny ant (I think it was an ant...) on the farthest right flower!
