90 minutes worth of the earth's rotation, captured as star trails between mine and my neighbours house.

Always wanted to do this shot but since they've got kids and I've got kids and the bathroom lights are always on, it wasn't happening. This weekend, though, they vacated to some festival and I just left my kids to be scared in the dark so the shot got made. Hey, check out the star reflections in the bedroom window. Forgot to tell my wife what I was doing though, so our bathroom light popped on halfway through...
