The Fantastic Four
Loosely based on <a href="http://www.sideshowtoy.com/?page_id=4489&amp;sku=9012&amp;ref=preview_page" rel="nofollow">Sideshow's Fantastic Four Diorama</a>, one of my favourite statues... I still hope to own it one day, though I'm going to begin my Sideshow statues with the acquisition of Scarlet Witch Comiquette (see Dr Teng's wonderful review of it <a href="http://www.whatsyourobsession.com/sideshow-collectibles-scarlet-witch-comiquette-review/" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Eagerly awaiting September.

Anyway, featured here are 6-7&quot; figures of the Fantastic Four. Mr Fantastic and Human Torch (custom haircut and paint) were released by Hasbro. Jessica Alba movie Sue Storm by Toybiz and finally, my latest purchase, Marvel Select Thing.

Must say, it was a disappointment. Despite its sculpt, size and weight, the figure is really a brick. The &quot;base&quot; that came with it was very forgettable as well... Not to mention his right leg broke off while I was posing it for this photoshoot. Sigh... I hope Abomination and Juggy don't turn out like him.

BTW, borrowed an image of the LSB Galactus bust by Sideshow for the back drop.
