It's rather nice to see a fast food restaurant closing down and got taken over by a sushi chain restaurant, I never seen that many sushi restaurant in London, and probably about the same number as Starbucks throughtout the captial.

I'm quite a lucky cunt to have the best one right by my doorstep in Wimbledon called Noodle Foodle, as you may have noticed from the name, the restaurant doesn't even look nice, rather it look generic and cheap, but damn no one else can complete with Noodle Foodle when it come to sushi.
