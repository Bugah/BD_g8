Summer Palace 颐和园 #2 [Beijing, China]
It's my last week in China before I go back to England to start my PhD, so I decided to get off my arse and do something. Today I went to the Summer Palace. The weather was great - not too hot during the day (which def helped as I walked non-stop for 6 hours), and very clear skies that allowed me to take some pretty flare shots and ones of the setting sun.
