High Line Park
A sketch of the steel sub structure and steps leading up to the High Line Park in Manhattan. I joined the Central Park Sketching &amp; Meetup Group for a great morning of sketching.

Thanks to Rodrick for the suggestion to join! Thanks to Jesse for organizing! 

This is 1 of 3 sketches from the session.
