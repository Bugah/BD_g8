Icing sugar
Finally, today I had the small small world project ended with this little friend due to me going back to my homeland soon. It was an amazing time working with them as the star of these photo. All of them are back to my garden happily now.

Funny...my Entomophobia is totally cured now.

Thank you for your viewing and comments.
