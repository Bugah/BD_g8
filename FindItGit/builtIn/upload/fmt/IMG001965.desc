I don't even know what this is. (and of course to make it worse, flickr sharpening had to go and get involved.)
So you know the new thick, dark forest area I've been playing around with lately, and provided the perfect location for my <a href="#//www.flickr.com/photos/iambradical/7404176112/in/photostream/" rel="nofollow">Bug in a Web</a> photo that I planned on re-doing? Yeah well evidently it's pretty much being cut down and thinned. I'm mad.
On a better note, I loved seeing everyone's edit's of yesterday's photos! It's so fun to see everyone's different approaches! I hope to be able to do something similar again in the future!
