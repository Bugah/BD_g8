Space Pirates Suck.
<i>I got this really cool job at the beginning of the month. I was supposed to be some sort of security guard for big cargo ships. It made me feel so cool, I had some power, a little authority, and I was even given a gun! This was a really easy job, since no one ever attacks this frigate. Who would ever attack a cargo ship carrying poor-quality condoms? No one, right, until today. The pirates rammed into the ship (that was really not cool) and the shock made me fall over! Then they got in through the little door I was supposed to guard! No they're shooting everywhere, it's so scary! Zach's on the ground and there's a lot of blood on him, I think he got shot. And why is Garry screaming now? He's supposed to be brave, he's the one who just ran out of our hiding spot to fight! Why is he screaming so loud? And why does it smell like burnt meat all of the sudden?
I'm freaking out, they're probably gonna come and kill me soon! I'm gonna die here like an idiot, behind a pile of crates full of cheap condoms. Space pirates suck.</i>

Well, crazily enough, this is my first actual build in four months!
Anyway, this is my entry for the top-shot contest.
This one took a while, but I finally got there!
Enjoy!
