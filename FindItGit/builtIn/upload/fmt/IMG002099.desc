The King (in Explore)
<b>The Golden Cobra</b>

Member of the genus Ophiophagus Hannah, a.k.a. the king cobra, a venomous elapid species found in southern Asia, I came across him on one of my recent travels when he was basking in the sun. Upon my proximity, he felt threatened and raised his hood. I was awed by the beauty of the animal. I had to get down on my stomach and crawl towards it to take this shot - wanted it to be an immaculate one if that meant it was going to be my last!

Extremely venomous, a local saying goes that if bitten by this cobra, you die before taking a second step!
