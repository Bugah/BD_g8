Ferrari 430 Scuderia
<b>430 Scuderia</b>
 
Ferrari 430 Scuderia at 2008 NAIASServing as the successor to the Challenge Stradale, the 430 Scuderia (scuderia meaning &quot;stable of horses&quot;, but also used in the context of motor racing teams, including Ferrari's own) was unveiled by Michael Schumacher at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show. Aimed to compete with cars like the Porsche RS-models and the Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera (superleggera meaning super light weight), it is lighter (by 100 kg/220 lb) and more powerful (515 PS (379 kW; 508 hp) at 8500 rpm) than the standard F430. Increased power comes from a revised intake, exhaust, and an ion-sensing knock-detection system that allows for a higher compression ratio. Thus the weight-to-power ratio is reduced from 2.96 kg/hp to 2.5 kg/hp. In addition to the weight saving measures, the Scuderia semi-automatic transmission gains improved &quot;Superfast&quot;, known as &quot;Superfast2&quot;, software for faster 60 millisecond shift-times. A new traction control system combines the F1-Trac traction and stability control with the E-Diff electronic differential. The Ferrari 430 Scuderia does 0-100 kilometres per hour (62 mph) in 3.6 seconds, with a top speed of 198 miles per hour (319 km/h). Ferrari claims that around their test track, Fiorano Circuit, it is faster than a Ferrari Enzo.

When tested on Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson said &quot;It appears to have been welded together by apes&quot;, he complained about its lack of equipment too. However, he also said that it was a knife-edge racer which is how Ferrari's should be. When given to the Stig to take round the Top Gear Test Track, it completed the cicuit in an impressive 1 minute 19.7 seconds which is faster than a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren (1.20.9) and a Porsche Carrera GT (1.19.8).
