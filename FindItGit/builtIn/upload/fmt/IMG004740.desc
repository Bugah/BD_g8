Oh yeah!!!! It was (wait for it....wait for it...) epic! Congrats to Eli Manning on being named the 2012 SuperBowl MPV and for leading the New York Giants to another SuperBowl Victory! I actually got to watch the whole game for the first time ever. 

I hope everyone had a blasting Sunday watching The Super Bowl XLV. It was a super game! :)
