Heavy artillery
Playing with this shot for about a week until it felt right. I'm trying my best to really work on the small details. I was walking past these guys right outside the Stock Exchange. Before I pointed the camera at them I asked if I could take a picture. They didn't say yes or no just kind of shrugged, so I took a quick picture and moved along!
