At the Masai village, I was given a wee hand carved stool to sit on, under the shade of an Acacia tree, where I was shown how to light a fire without matches. It took them probably less than a minute to produce the result you see here. There was no shortage of very dry tinder, and some crumbled cow dung helped things along. They asked me if I had ever seen fire produced this way, and I had to explain about a certain &quot; Ray Mears&quot; that UK TV viewers will be all too familiar with !! I also told them it would be more of a challenge to them in my native Scotland where things are always wet owing to the high rainfall !
I would have been very happy to stay under that Acacia tree for quite some time !!

The second picture shows how they did it. A bit of deliberate blur to depict the action.
