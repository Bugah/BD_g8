Beads And Flowers Are One Thing, But Having You Is Something
Going back to a bit of still life photography now as i have not done much in this area for a while now. I am really getting into doing diptych's lately so really i am just doing some simple experiments. I found it really hard to come up with a title for this image/photograph as there really is not a lot of meaning behind both shots tied together. So the title words are partly from heavy rock metal and indie band 'Iron Butterfly' who i am not a particular fan of but it did help me though by using the song lyrics to one of their songs. I have slightly rearranged the words into my own to make it more personal to me.

When i was listening to a song by the band Elbow which is called 'One Day Like This' it made me think of these two photographs. So i can sort of relate it back to that song. So on the day i taken both these shots which i think work very well together, i was very bored so i just got my camera out and just experimented really using natural window light. I got a plate then just spread purple glitter, then placed a few beads and petals on to the plate. I just want to thank everybody on flickr for commenting on this photograph because i have used some of those words as my tags.

I wanted there to be a certain softness behind both images/photographs with a sense of beauty conveyed by the pink colors. There is also a little bit of a twist with my intense hand holding onto the flower. This photograph is open to many interpretations but i will leave that for the audience to decide. It could maybe relate to friendship or not. I will not give no more away now.
