Walt Disney World - Main Street USA Panorama
Okay, so this may look like another fisheye shot, but it's not.  This is three UWA shots of Main Street, merged together in CS3.  I wish I did multiple exposures for each so I could control some of the highlights better, but I guess I'll get one of those at Christmas!  Pretty quick edit on this as I am hard at work on the upcoming trip report (over 500 images edited this weekend).  Hopefully I didn't mess up anything with the quick edit...

EDIT: Does there appear to be a bad yellow and green tint to the photo? On my screen at home, the lights look a tad yellow (mostly white), but here at work, it looks VERY yellow.  I think itâ€™s time to buy a monitor calibrator.
