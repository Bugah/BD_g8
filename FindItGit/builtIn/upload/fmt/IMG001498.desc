Bahrain International Circuit during the F1 testing back in February  i had to edit this one . i sharpen it and made some crop on the pic coz i used my wide lens 18-55mm didnt have my 70-300mm back then ...

ITS NOT EASY to take an F1 car pic while its speeding 200 kmh to 300 kmh ! its HARD trust me u have to move super fast to get the shot u want
