The Beginning, Lake Tahoe, Ca
**Please take a look on BLACK**

Just returned from a nearly 1700 mile bootcamp photoscursion over the course of 5 days, with the final 800 miles all coming on the last day.  We still managed to shoot 4 locations that day!  
Living out of the back of the Tacoma and a bivie sack, my great friend Micah and I were able to get to 11 or 12 different spots in California, and should have enough processing to get us through the summer!  
This shot is from the first evening of the trip up in Lake Tahoe before we turned south down the 395.  We didn't get the color explosion we were hoping for, but did get some nice illumination on the clouds.  â€¦and don't worry, we got some explosions later!  
Cheers Everyone, and happy shooting.  -jared r.
