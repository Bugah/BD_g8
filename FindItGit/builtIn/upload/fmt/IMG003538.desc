I'm really enjoying this whole series of things I find in my basement on a white background, this is probably my favorite so far, but i wanna do a lot more photos like this. The shots are really simple, but so far every edit has looked completely different in color and style. I'm excited to see how the next shot comes out. This is most likely going to be my band's (Honeymoon) album art for our EP.
