Open Fire!
Aimed into the right direction, using it's sophisticated TLAR(*) gunsight, this ancient cannon on Monte Fort will do a great job improving the Macau skyline.

Let's face it: As good as it looks <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cnmark/2092106571/">at night</a> and from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cnmark/3001553695/">certain angles at daytime</a> - the Grand Lisboa is just a grand monstrosity from most viewpoints.

(*) just for your peace of mind: TLAR = <u>T</u>hat <u>L</u>ooks <u>A</u>bout <u>R</u>ight.
