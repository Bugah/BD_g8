Edge of the Earth...
This is the rest area between Talofofo Falls #1 and #2.  

On the left hand side where you see the ducks feeding on fish is the edge of Falls #2. 

Far across the shack is the pathway to Yokoi's Cave.  SGT Shoichi Yokoi  is the famous Japanese Soldier who evaded capture for more than 27 years after World War II.  Please read more about this brave Soldier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoichi_Yokoi">Here!</a>
