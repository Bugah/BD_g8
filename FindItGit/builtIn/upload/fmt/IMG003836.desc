CARLOS (Goldfield gunfighter)
You will never meet a nicer guy then Carlos one of the gunfighters at Goldfield Ghost town near Apache Junction AZ.

But you might not know it from looking at this photo I took during the gunfight.   Also note he has his left hand on a huge machete for close in combat.

This guy should be in the movies!!

Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera and Canon EF 85mm F/1.2L II USM Lens.
