It's short. My eyes were dying from editing all 332 pictures.

Thank you so much to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skinnytiger10/">Panda</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/from_my_d40/">Rebecca</a> for the testimonials! :)

Still not back into the hang of photography yet. Will be on and off for the next few days until I feel fully ready to continue with 365. I suppose this is kind of a reminder to myself, as well. To keep going. Thank you for 30000 stream views! :)
Many people have been mailing me asking me stuff about editing and I take ages to reply each one personally because I tend to type years worth of reading. So I enabled my <a href="http://www.formspring.me/amandamabel" rel="nofollow">formspring</a> back again. If I start getting inappropriate questions I'm just gonna disable it (again). Haha
