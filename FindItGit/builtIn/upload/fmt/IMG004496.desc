One Moment
Lake Mackenzie
New Zealand

If I had to pick one single moment in our last trip that I could somehow frame in my mind - this would be it. A day of being sodden in the rain walking the Routeburn could have resulted in moping, but the skies began to clear which eventually gave rise to this stunning sunset. Everyone else was back in the hut trying to get warm and really didn't know what they were missing out on! People often ask if the appearance is photoshopped - Well, I can tell you NOTHING I could do in post process would match what it was like to be there.  I'm going to be 100% stubborn here with the naysayers who may claim I'm lying - so yes, even though this has been edited, REALITY WAS BETTER!!!
