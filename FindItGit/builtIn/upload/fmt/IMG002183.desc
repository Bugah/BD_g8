Ghent, the real diamond of Flanders (1st series)
In a unique way, Ghent has managed to <b>preserve its medieval power</b> while keeping up with the times. The city center alone is a <b>showcase of medieval Flemish wealth and commercial success</b>. Modern Ghent certainly cannot be overlooked in Belgium. The city has an important harbor, thanks to the canal Ghent-Terneuzen which allows sea-going vessels to bring their products to the city and its industrial hinterland. The Ghent University continues to grow in importance. The presence of so many <b>young people and students</b> has turned Ghent into an important Flemish cultural center.
Ghent is also the <b>flower city of Belgium</b>. Flower growers from the region around Ghent sell their beautiful begonia's and azalea's all over the world. Every 5 years the successful 'Gentse FloraliÃ«n&quot; ( Ghent Flower Show) attracts thousands to the city. Ghent offers a <b>splendid combination of impressiveness and idyllic charm of the proud and (in former times) often rebellious city of Ghent</b>
