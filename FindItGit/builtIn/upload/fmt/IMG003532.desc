Classic Beelitz - new wrapping
One of my &quot;old&quot; Beelitz shots. I have learned a lot of new ways to process photos and HDR images this year, and I'm honestly not so happy with a lot of my previous Beelitz shots and edits. Many shots are too saturated, and have nasty black frames around them. So I just had to redo some of the shots with new techniques.

History of the place: Beelitz-Heilstätten west of Berlin, is an amazing complex of 60 abandoned and derelict hospital buildings. The oldest buildings are from 1898 drawn by architect Heino Schmieden. 

The complex became a war hospital during WW1. In 1916 Adolf Hitler was recovering here after being shot in the leg in the Battle of the Somme.

After WW2 the hospital was occupied by Soviet forces. They left in 1995.

If you are inspired to do urban exploration after seeing my pictures, do so at your own risk. It can be dangerous and illegal and I'm not responsible for your decisions and actions. Don't steal things, break in or vandalize places.</i> </b>
