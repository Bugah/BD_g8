the thin ice (1)
If you should go skating,
On the thin ice of modern life,
Dragging behind you the silent reproach,
Of a million tear-stained eyes,
DonÂ´t be surprised when a crack in the ice,
Appears under your feet.

You slip out of your depth and out of your mind,
With your fear flowing out behind you,

As you claw the thin ice.
