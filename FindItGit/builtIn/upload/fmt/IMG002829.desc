The Awakening
On the first day of the Cairns to Brisbane photography tour at the stunning tropical beach of Palm Cove, we set up for a sunrise and John Armytage decided to change his exposure settings on a stitched panoramic, now this is a big no no, as you get all sorts of problems, making it very difficult to stitch. Thinking about this over the weekend it dawned on me that maybe this could work, so at the SS Dicky for sunrise I tried a technique I like to call the Chorus Effect. 

Basically I did a series of frames at f32 for 2 minutes a frame, again at f2.8 for 1 second a frame and finally f16 for 30 seconds a frame. Blending them all together allows you to capture the movement in the background clouds, crisp clouds on the horizon and a smooth textured ocean.

I'd like to thank John, Dex, Jay, Stanley and Bruce for joining me on my tropical adventure and for all their amazing talents and inspiration.
