Reykjanes ...
First one from a flickr photo trip to Reykjanes with arnitr ( <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/arnitr">flickr.com/photos/arnitr</a> ) and hkvam ( <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hkvam/">flickr.com/photos/hkvam/</a> ).  If you look closely you can see that arnitr is doubleexposed in this image, which actually is a triple exposure.
