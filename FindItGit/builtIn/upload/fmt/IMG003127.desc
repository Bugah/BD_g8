Taken under a tunnel of glass at the 'Aquarium of the Pacific' in Long Beach (CA).

There were red circle things for people to hold up so that the sea lions would follow them around but this family had two of them captivated by a ball. The children were then captivated by the sea lions and I was captivated by it all.

All captured with the new 14-24mm lens that I bought that morning. I had heard people say that if you are thinking about buying this lens then just do it and now I can see why. I can't describe how great this lens truly is. I know it's expensive but seriously... it's worth twice they money they charge!!!
