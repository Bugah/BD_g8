Maybe you can help...
I need help finding a good deal for a desktop that will last me a while and be able to hold my massive archive and run a few things at once. Does anybody have some good pointers? Know of deals or have any hookups? Let me know. I need all the help I can get. You can leave a message or flickrmail me or e-mail me at jordan@thepieshops.com

Thanks a million,
Jordan
