Autumn
Davy - 360 flip 
I wanted to shoot this very differently, head on, with a fast prime and lit with a couple of speedlights.

In typical Fenrich style it started raining, my flash triggers were being utter pricks and composition was feeling wrong.
So I settled for a fish eye gutter shot with a strobe in the hotshoe.
Well next time I'll try get it right.
