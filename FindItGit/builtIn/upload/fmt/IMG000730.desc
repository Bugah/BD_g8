Sandy Shore, Lake Tahoe- snow walk *Week 24/52*
Finally got around to edit some of the photos I took in Tahoe from a couple weeks ago.
Took this one right after sunset. Was kinda bummed, I got skunked on the trip. Probably left with only 4 or 5 decent shots. The is the last show of the night that I was able to get. 
Knee deep snow, in freezing weather. I love it &lt;3
