Camo'd sniper rifle
I made a sniper rifle, and when it was finished I decided I should camo it for it would be awesome.
It IS awesome, however, it wouldn't let me save the DAMN code. Hell the code didn't even show up!

So I screencapped it, added watermark, et voil√†. Le sniper. Too bad I don't have te camo'd version code :(

Tell me what you think.
