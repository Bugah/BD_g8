The Azure Cathedral
While walking through the streets around the edges of Las Ramblas, I found this secret place.  I'm not sure I could even find it again.  Maybe one of our smart readers knows exactly where it is.  Anyway, the place was quite beautiful, as you can see.  It was also pretty much empty, so I had no trouble moving around to find the interesting shots.
