busy busy busy combined
I couldn't quite belive this, I took these two shoots almost a year apart from each other on two seperate trips, one in the daytime, one at night. As both started appearing in my interestingness thing I realised quite how similar they were so put it to the test. There is a gradient mask mixing the two pictures and they lined up exactly perfectly!

I guess no matter how long between shots you still end up with an eye for similar things!
