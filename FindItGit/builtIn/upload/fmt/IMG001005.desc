heading for Pandanon
<i>Getting there.</i> Rent motorized boats from any point in Mactan, from the northend port of Punta Engano beside the Hilton, through any of the beach resorts in Maribago, Agus or Marigondon, to the southend port of Cordova. Summer weekend prices start at about P3,500 for a 30-person sized boat to about P5,000 if you donâ€™t haggle. Discounts or premiums are common depending on season and boat size.
