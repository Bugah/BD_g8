Animal Kingdom - King of the Jungle
So, it is officially story time. And this is a pretty awesome story if I do say so myself. On January 6th, we planned on going to the Magic Kingdom, and then hitting Animal Kingdom for some EMH shooting. After meeting up with Susan from Canada(DigitalSLG) a couple of times, she said she would be in AK this day/night and to give her a call to meetup. So when we arrived at AK, I called her, and we met. She told us about how when she went to get fastpasses for Kilimanjaro Safaris that the machines were broken, and that CM's were just asking how many in your party. Being the wonderful and generous human being she is she asked for 4 FP's when she only needed 2. When we met, she gave us the FP's, and we were thrilled, since the wait was quite long and we wouldn't have been able to ride that day without the FP's. Once we got on the ride, we were even more thrilled, since we save the elusive Lion for the first time ever. So moral of the story is, if you ever hear that a Canadian will be down in Disney the same time as you, make the effort to meet them and be friends.

This shot is also a reason why I'm thinking about buying either a 1.4x or 2.0x extender for my 70-200 lens. This is about a 70% crop of the original 200mm shot. I think it would be perfect for a ride like KS. Thanks for lookin', and have a great day!!
