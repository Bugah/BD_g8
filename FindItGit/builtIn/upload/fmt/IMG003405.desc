It’s a dog’s life...

<b>...but at least we have each other.</b>

Most of our expressions that include dog are old enough to be based in times when dogs were not cosseted, but were kept as watchdogs or hunting animals, not as pets. They often weren’t allowed in the house, but were kept in kennels, fed scraps, worked hard, and often died young. So <i>“going to the dogs, dog tired, to die like a dog, dog’s dinner, dogsbody, dog eat dog”</i> and <i>“a dog’s life”</i> all refer to a state of affairs best avoided. Specifically, <i>“a dog’s life”</i> is first recorded in the sixteenth century and seems to have remained in the language with the sense of “a life of misery” or “of miserable subserviency” ever since.
