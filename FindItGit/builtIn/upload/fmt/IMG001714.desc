Never Again
In a church on the outskirts of Nyamata, Rwanda, Madame Celaphine receives guests day after day as one of the matrons of a site where over 10,000 Tutsis were slaughtered in 1994.  

In the days and weeks immediately following the genocide, men and women of the village slept overnight in the church - despite the conditions - to keep the Hutu, who had been killers, from removing evidence that would indict them -- and also to keep looters from pillaging.  

Madame Celaphine and two other women keep the church site as a memorial to those who lost their life and to ensure that a massacre such as theirs happens &quot;Never Again.&quot;
