Printed Custom Space Police 3 Legs
I am going to be getting White, light bley, and tan legs printed with a SP legs design. These are not final samples or even a real product, these are just edited photos. I would like your feedback on the design as well. And, what is the maximum you would pay for a pair of these?
<b>CAC is NOT printing these.</b>
