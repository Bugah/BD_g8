Planet Not
The view of  <i>Planet Not</i> from my space station window has to be seen to be believed!  ;-)))
<b>
Image Notes</b>:  I noticed a recent moonlit Pawnee Grasslands thunderstorm sky shot looked much like Earth from space when flipped vertically so I decided to have some Photoshop fun (all source images are mine), hope you all likey!
