Hodgepodge of Fireworks
I hope you all like fireworks, SpectroMagic!, Finding Nemo: the Musical, and dark ride shots, because that's about all I have left from last year's trips to WDW (and while that seems like a great variety of shots, it isn't really--75% of my remaining usable shots are of Wishes and SpectroMagic!, and most of the good shots I have already posted) besides Christmas shots, which I won't post until around mid-November.  

If you begin to bore of these shots, let me know, and I'll start thinking up off-the-wall captions...at least then <i>something</i> about the posts will be entertaining!
