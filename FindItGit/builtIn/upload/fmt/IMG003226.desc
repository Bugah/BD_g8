a flickr story
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58837549@N00">Seven</a> and I didn't actually meet through flickr. 
That's just how we found each other again, after 17 years. 
Here is the story:

In 1989 I was living in Philadelphia with my friend, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/72283494/in/set-72157602361177887/">Joe</a> from the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1228817505185494583">Dead Milkmen</a>. My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/264086049/in/set-72057594055342641/">parents</a> had recently passed away, and Joe was nice enough to let me move in. I stuffed his tiny West Phiily apartment with furniture and years worth of family junk that was sentimental and homeless. My college boyfriend, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/462297100/in/set-1409253/">Mike</a> (now <a href="http://www.henrysdiary.com/archives/000134.shtml"></a><a href="http://www.henrysdiary.com/archives/000134.shtml">Henry's dad</a>), left for graduate school in Texas and I knew I wouldn't be in Philly for long. In 1990 I took off for Austin Texas in a Toyota Tercel leaving all my furniture and art projects and Joe behind.

Pretty soon, Joe met Seven and invited him to move to Philadelphia to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_Me_Zoo">music</a>. Seven moved into my old room and spent the next few years surrounded by pictures and stories about me, <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2319/2238798480_592319383a.jpg?v=0">my art, my furniture and everything else that didn't fit in a hatchback</a>. He slept in the bed that belonged to my parents, he ate at a table my dad built, he lived with Joe as I had, and he felt like he knew me.

I talked to Joe a lot and we wrote letters, and he always went on and on about this kid named &quot;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sevenmorris/189895489/in/set-1649304/">Seven</a>&quot;. They were now <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2280/2238839606_8ab591e34f.jpg?v=0">best friends</a> and I was a little jealous. I remember getting <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2035/2238003373_9274fd2f3c.jpg?v=0">pictures of Seven</a> from Joe. Seven sitting at the lion's foot table dad painted. Seven next to a lamp I bought at Village thrift. Seven in my room <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2419/2238014053_9c8b1fdb47.jpg?v=0">painting my furniture</a>!

We went on to lead lives, two of them, for 17 years.

A few years ago <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dorkmaster/">Mike</a> (by then my ex) made a <a href="http://store.muledesign.com/shirts/philly.php">T-shirt</a>. He wanted to get one to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dorkmaster/1808761/">Rodney</a> and found <a href="http://www.deadmilkmen.com/dean-cleans-drumsticks-in-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/">Dean</a> on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deansabatino/">Flickr</a>. Mike talked me into getting a flickr account and told me about Dean who was the older brother of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluberd/243825580/in/set-72157594352380028/">my best friend since grade school</a>. This tie in was how <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluberd/167828525/in/set-72157594202239619/">I met Joe</a> back in 1983. 

Then one day <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deansabatino/86657119/in/photostream/">Dean bought a guitar</a> and next to the 1st comment was a name I remembered. I clicked through and saw a much <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sevenmorris/76949735/in/set-1649304/">older version</a> of that kid in Joe's photos. I hit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sevenmorris/78211204/favorites/">fave</a> on a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sevenmorris/76953115/">few</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sevenmorris/267494182/">pictures</a>. So <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/106166585/in/set-1409253/">did</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/106166585/in/set-1409253/"> </a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/85514982/in/set-1409253/">he</a>. Then a few months later I got an email basically saying, &quot;Hi, we both know Joe and this is what's been going on with me&quot;. I wrote back, he wrote back. Then one day he wrote <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tlong/433141992/in/set-1345978/">something</a> on a photo that I wasn't expecting.
Coincidentally, my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/576398929/in/set-72157600668852265/">sister</a> was in the process of moving to Asheville NC, and that is where he <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sevenmorris/sets/72157594310234152/">lived</a>. I went to visit her. I spent more time with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/654324879/in/set-72157600668852265/">him</a>. Two months later Seven <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/1084342138/in/set-72157603640442434/">moved out here</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/1084342138/in/set-72157603640442434/"></a>.

I should have known all along that if Joe liked him he was a pretty amazing guy.
Now I am twice as sure because <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/sets/1344592/">Henry</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlong/2135800713/in/set-72157603640442434/">thinks he's ok</a> too.
