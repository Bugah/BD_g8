Caitlin Rose's Australian cake decorations
My sister, Máire had a baby, Caitlin Rose in October. She and her Australian husband, Michael have recently moved  to Jakarta (from Sidney)  but are here in Northern Ireland this week for the Christening. Máire bought a M&amp;S Noah’s ark cake but wanted it to have an Australian theme so Melissa (with help from Katie and Ellen) made some Australian mammals from fondant icing to add to the more conventional Ark passengers.  They made 3 Koalas (mummy, daddy and baby) , a kangaroo with a joey and a duck-billed platypus.
