i think they found nemo
At the Tennessee Aquarium there is a tank that has an area that kids can go under and stand up, surrounded by the water.  I happened to see these kids finding Nemo and thought it was a cool shot.  <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=3402195977&amp;size=large">
