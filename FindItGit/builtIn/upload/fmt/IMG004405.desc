Zen Garden - Haida Gwaii
Balancing Rock , just north of Skidegate , very early in the morning . There is not a lot of people most of the time but at that time I was absolutely alone. Entire place has the “ out of this world “ fell , somehow prehistoric and untouched . Great to spend sunrise there .
