Hello everyone, I finally got my laptop back today after a month. I have been taking photos, but haven't been able to edit them . I have been waiting to upload this one for quite a while. Hope you like it! 

I also sold my first photo recently to a photo magazine in the UK called <b><i>Practical Photography</i></b>, for July's issue. So if you are in the UK, be sure to check it out.

I am on my way back to Vancouver tomorrow. Hoping to get some good shots. =)

<b>Location Info..</b>
The Johnson Street Bridge is a bascule bridge that spans the harbour of Victoria, British Columbia. It is nicknamed &quot;Big Blue&quot; because of its distinctive blue colour.

The bascule spans were designed by the Strauss Bascule Company Limited and were fabricated in Ontario. The sub-structure was built by the City of Victoria Engineering Department and required 9, 144 cubic metres of concrete. The bridge was completed in January 1924 at a cost of C$918,000. The original wood deck was replaced by a steel grid in 1966 and the steel structure was repainted in 1979 as part of an extensive renovation.

The bridge has two opening spans of 45 m (148 ft) that operate independently, a three-lane highway span of 350 tonnes and a railway span of 150 tons. The approaches are fixed girders, the east is 34 m (112 ft) and the west is 22 m (72 ft). The counterweights are made of hollow concrete and total 780 tonnes. Daily traffic is 30,000 vehicles.
