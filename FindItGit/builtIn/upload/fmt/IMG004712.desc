Day Two Hundred Two

Today was a scheduled photoshoot with <a href="http://twitter.com/biz" rel="nofollow">Biz</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/ev" rel="nofollow">Ev</a>. Those photos are being personally delivered to the two of them for various press purposes etc.

I pulled this one out of Biz because it's just a great shot of Biz in an informal setting and really describes the mood of Twitter.

I could describe why this photo works so well with having all the busyness yet calm focus. But there's another reason why Biz's hands are twirling quickly, which is because there are fresh sandwhiches directly behind me (lunch time).
