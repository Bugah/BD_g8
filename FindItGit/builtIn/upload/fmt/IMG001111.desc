Arno reflections in Florence
The Arno river originates on Mount Falterona in the Casentino area of the Apennines, and takes initially a southward curve. The river turns to the west near Arezzo passing through Florence, Empoli and Pisa, flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea at Marina di Pisa. (wikipedia)

I caught this sunset reflection shot on the Arno River in Florence during our trip to Italy last fall.  It is a very peaceful river at sunset.
