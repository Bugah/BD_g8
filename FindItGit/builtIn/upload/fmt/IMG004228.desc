Tee Off Silhouette
A round of golf followed by some shots..... What could be better?  I decided to go with Dan and his brother to take some photos while they played 18 holes. It was a hot day and walking 7km in the heat kind of drains your energy but I wasn't going to leave until I got a  few silhouette shots of the boys..... More to come over the next few months 

:D  Please enjoy
