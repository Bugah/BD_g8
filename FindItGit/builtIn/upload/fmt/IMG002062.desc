1977 Led Zeppelin - Jimmy Page - Robert Plant #1 70s Rock Concert
Led Zeppelin 1977 - Jimmy Page - Robert Plant on stage @ MSG / Madison Square Garden. If you had a choice of which rock concert to be at in the 20th Century, I feel that this one would be in the top 10. I was there with about 8 friends. Minolta XE-7 400mm preset lens with Kodacolor II 100. As proof that I took this, i still have the negative. It was just scanned with my Konica-Minolta DiMage Scan Elite 5400 II.
