Lit by the sun, beat by the men
I had mentioned some time ago that one day I had gone out to take some photos of stray cats and dogs for an NGO. I found this cat and two others hanging around. And while the others bolted away as I approached, this one stayed and kept looking at me as if saying: &quot;if you are going to kill me, do it already.&quot;
When I approached it enough to be at hand's reach, it started to walk away, in a visibly painful limp. So I backed off and it stopped moving as well. I left it behind with a sore spot in my heart.

A neighbor of mine has adopted a cat she found laying down by the sidewalk, crying a faint meow. It was all wet and she soon found out to be blood. She got it and took it right away to the vet. There she found out it had been severely beaten up, and one of its hind leg was so smashed, it would have to be amputated.
The cat is doing good now, and has found a loving home, but sometimes I'm on my room, or by the front gate and I can hear an awful sound of something falling on the floor, like a potato sack falling hard from high above. It's the cat slumping from the roof to the floor. It actually jumps off, but the sound it makes can only mean that it's got to be painful.

I want to win the lottery, so I can build an animal shelter and stop just watching these sad things passively :(
