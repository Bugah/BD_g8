We are back from Canada and our summer garden is showing beautiful early autumn colour (18th September)

On 10th September we returned after a beautiful three week stay in Alberta and British Columbia. In Canada we received amazing friendship and hospitality from our friends in Alberta and then wonderful hospitality from our son and girlfriend in Whistler where they have been working throughout the last two years.
We have so many people to thank however,  especially we must thank our two daughters Sarah and Liz and son Alex who, despite busy day jobs,  cared for this area of our garden whilst we were away.  It was in such excellent condition on our return however, it was not that easy for them since they had to tidy up considerable plant damage due to severe storm force winds on 7th September! .....soon we will post a photo of some of the plant carnage taken on Alex's mobile phone!
