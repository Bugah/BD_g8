Cloud Gate, a public sculpture by Indian-born British artist Anish Kapoor, is the centerpiece of the AT&amp;T Plaza in Millennium Park within the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States. The sculpture and AT&amp;T Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed &quot;The Bean&quot; because of its bean-like shape. Made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It is 33 feet by 66 feet by 42 feet (10 m × 20 m × 13 m), and weighs 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons).
