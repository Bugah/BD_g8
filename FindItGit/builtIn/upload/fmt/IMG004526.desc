In this area, the Japanese Macaques are free to run across the river, up and down the mountain, or take a nice hot bath.  No humans are alowed in this bath however, only the monkies may bathe here.  These animals are adapted to the cold and mountainous terain and live in all the mountain areas of Japan.  In the deep snow of winter they survive by eating the bark off of trees.
