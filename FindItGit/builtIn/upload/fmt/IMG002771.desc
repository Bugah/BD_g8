back from the future
<i>Almost</i> unedited...  I'm not necessarily back from hiatus yet, but I wanted to extend my appreciation to <a href="http://www.shutterphoto.net/article/boomtown-by-brian-day" rel="nofollow">Shutter Photo</a> for their article on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brianday/4485886174">Boomtown</a> photo this morning, and figured what better way to say thanks than to do it with another image!
