longtail on the beach
A longtail boat on the beach on Ko Hai, southern Thailand.

Added to Cream of the Crop as my most popular photo.

UPDATE: No longer my most popular photo. Completely superseded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beneteau/1478869/">this one</a> which seems to have been featured on the Flickr home page or something like that.
