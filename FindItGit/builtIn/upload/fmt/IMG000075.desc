Pluto's Toy (Explore)
I was watching Pluto interact with the kids, when this little boy came up and put the silver robot Pluto on the ground and made him hop up and down with the remote...
Big Pluto went crazy, got down on all fours and started doing exactly what the toy was doing!
This went on for a good 5 minutes, the crowd and the line was loving it!  Pluto was a real joy!
