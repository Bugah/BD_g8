How U doing?
<b>Nikon D200, 50mm, f/2,8, 1/50s, ISO 640, 04:14 hrs, flash fired.</b>

<b>EXPLORED 10/03/08 #5</b>

Found this friendly froggy on a friend's country house in Morretes/Paran√°/Brazil. This big-eyed voyeur was starying at me, hanging on a leaf, just above my head, while I was (don't laugh at me) taking a piss on a bush (it was 4 a.m, I was a bit drunk and the bathroom was too far away LOL). 
I hate to shoot with the built-in flash, but I didn't had other option, so I cranked the ISO a bit and reduced the flash to the minimum power. I took at least 10 pictures with diferent perspectives, but only saved 4 of them. The 50mm I used has only manual focus, so the lack of available lights cumulated with the high ingestion of alcohol created an insurmountable barrier to achieve a perfect shot.

<b>Post-processing info</b>: a 5X5 square crop to get more details of the subject and improve the composition, Noise Ninja and Kodak Digital Airbush Professional on the background to reduce the grains, a bit of unsharp mask on the froggy, some color balance changing to make it more natural due to the flash fired. That's it!
