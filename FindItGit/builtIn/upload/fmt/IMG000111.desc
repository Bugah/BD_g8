So, I've had this shot in mind for awhile now and finally decided to sit down and give it a go.

On my last trip to WDW, I saw the Vinyl Mickey's (which I'm sure everyone has seen at this point) and was intrigued to pick up one, or two or three!

He's a cool little 2 1/2 inch vinyl, well, Mickey!  So, due to being extra festive these holidays, I decided to include the lil' guy and see how it turned out!
