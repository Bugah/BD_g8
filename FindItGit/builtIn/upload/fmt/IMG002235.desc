Going up to the Gothic gallery
On the &quot;second floor&quot; of the Basilica of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/wimpers/tags/halle/"><b>Halle</b></a> (city in Belgium), there is a narrow gallery to go around the church building. Few people can walk here. 
But the high-gothic architecture is amazing at every level !
