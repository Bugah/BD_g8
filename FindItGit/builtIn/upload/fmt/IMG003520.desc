Star Island
Star Island is an oval-shaped artificial island in Biscayne Bay, within the City of Miami Beach, Florida. It is south of the Venetian Islands and just east of Palm Island and Hibiscus Island. It was created by Carl Fisher, co-founder of Miami Beach, and completed in 1922 by the Army Corps of Engineers by dredging sand. It is connected to the MacArthur Causeway and the rest of Miami Beach by Bridge Road. There are 35 home sites on the island.

The island has been the home of many wealthy residents, including celebrities, since its creation. Don Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, Lenny Kravitz, Will Smith, Gloria Estefan, Rosie O'Donnell, Paulina Rubio, Madonna, Alex Rodriguez, P.Diddy, and Sylvester Stallone have owned property on Star Island.
