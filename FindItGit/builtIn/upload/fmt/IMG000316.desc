Sarah and Tom's Walt Disney World Top 30 Must Sees - #6
Hi and Welcome back to the Walt Disney World Top 30 Must Sees, the countdown that focuses on the top 30 things that Sarah and I are looking forward to doing on our August trip to Walt Disney World. Thanks for joining us as we are inside the one week mark!

<i>Paging Mr. Morrow, Mr. Tom Morrow...land, the place where you step into the past’s future as you join the Tomorrowland Metro-Retro Historical Society for a glimpse into the future that never was.</i>

For Tomorrowland to rank so highly on this list despite two of its all-stars being under the knife during our trip, it must have some really powerful draw to compensate. That powerful draw is Tomorrowland after-dark. No part of any park transforms as much as Tomorrowland does after the sun goes down. The atmosphere of the land is almost unexplainable. I’ll try, anyway.

Some may attribute it to the neon and the flashing lights, but it isn’t just that. I think another aspect is the views offered from Tomorrowland of other aspects of the park, and the qualities the attractions (well, now only Astro Orbiter) take on at night. There there also is the intangible: that feeling that night is &quot;just better&quot; in Tomorrowland. The area music, which is the best area music anywhere, sounds better; the ice cream tastes better; the snacks from the Lunching Pad taste better; and of course the views look better. The views are the obvious part. The Avenue of the Planets looks great from the bridge to Tomorrowland, the neon lines that criss-cross the land are a beauty, and the steel palms captivate. Even without those two heavy hitters, Carousel of Progress, Buzz, and the general ambiance of Tomorrowland at night more than compensate, making Tomorrowland at night one of our premiere destinations next week!
