It has been a while since I posted my last ones....catching up now my friends. 
This is one from my recent trip with Glen to Moreton Island where we were witnessing a great natural spectacle. Do I really need to say anything here.....just look at this landscape and soak it in. It is a large tidal pool where we enjoyed the silence and absence of civilisation. 

For those of you with an iphone, I have 100 of my &quot;best&quot; in an application called &quot;ifolio&quot;. It is a free application
