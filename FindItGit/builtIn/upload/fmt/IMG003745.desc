Halo Reach Warthog Variants
This morning I got bored, so I decided to go back and work on my Warthog design.  First I replace the suspension system with my new steering one.  Then I worked on the rocket and Gauss turret renditions.

Tell me what you think!  Do you like the steering or suspension better?
