- Finally, it seems that flickr has fixed the &quot;3 views for 1 comment&quot; bug. A few months ago, they had fixed the runaway views bug (where you could get more than 40K views in a day). We just have to get used to the low numbers (at least those are real numbers now).

- Yesterday I had the chance to test my sigma 10-20mm at the Olympic stadium. It yielded interesting results, I'll have to make more shots with it soon :-)
