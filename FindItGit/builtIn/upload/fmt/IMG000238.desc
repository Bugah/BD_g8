Bellevue Above & Beyond
Behold the sister (or stepsister, rather) city of Seattle -- Bellevue.  Often considered and referred to as a suburb, Bellevue is an independent city with more than 100,000 residents (a third of whom are millionaires).

Before Microsoft’s main campus opened in nearby Redmond (a true suburb), its headquarters was in Bellevue.  Other companies  headquartered in Bellevue include Eddie Bauer, T-Mobile, and Expedia.com.

In the foreground is the massive Lake Washington, which measures 22 miles (35km) from north to south.   Spanning the lake is the Lacey Murrow Memorial Bridge (or the “Interstate 90 Bridge” as we locals call it).   It is the world’s second longest floating bridge.

For trivia, the planet’s first and third longest floating bridges are also located in Washington State.  The first is the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiascapes/5708234534">Evergreen Point Bridge</a>.  The third longest floating bridge is the Hood Canal Bridge, located 30 miles west of Seattle.

Have a wonderful weekend!
