Day 140: Shot Through the Heart
And you're to blame.
You give love a bad name.

Happy Valentine's Day everyone!  Sorry for the blood.  Haha.  Without it, it just looked so bland and fake...not that this is suppose to look real or anything.  :)  I just like to make things more interesting...and blood is interesting to me.  :P
