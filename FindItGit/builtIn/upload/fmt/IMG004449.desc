Thor's Hammer - Bryce Canyon National Park
I don’t want to leave Bryce Canyon without showing my version(s) of one of the most famous rock formations in Bryce Canyon Amphitheatre: <b>Thor’s Hammer</b>.

<b>Bryce Canyon National Park</b> is a national park located in southwestern Utah in the United States. Contained within the park is Bryce Canyon. Despite its name, this is not actually a canyon, but rather a giant natural amphitheatre created by erosion along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce is distinctive due to its geological structures, called <b>hoodoos</b>, formed from wind, water, and ice erosion of the river and lakebed sedimentary rocks. The red, orange and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views to visitors. (Source: Wikipedia)
