The Falkirk wheel at night again
A final shot from my trip to the excellent architectural conundrum that is the Falkirk Wheel.

I think I prefer the composition of this shot to my previous ones, it seems a little more dynamic (please tell me what you think). 

The cloud layer was quite low on this night so the orange colour is coming from the reflection of the Falkirk streetlights on the clouds. I did a bit warming and brightening, too, afterwards.

Nikon D300 I Nikon 17-70mm F3.5-4.5 I No ND filters (dark so not much point).
