A blessed window ...
Explore 22.07.08

This type of window - with an icon below - can be found all over Prague.
This particular one  is in Mala Strana - the figure of the Virgin and Child to protect the house, the lion is the symblol of Czech Kingdom and above it the Papal coat of arms .
They certainly also  &quot;dress&quot; a building giving them a very noble apperance.

I apologize if I dont comment on all but I am still on/off.
