Roca
I have a handful of shots to upload but wanted to space out the sunbursts as I seem to only be shooting as sunset at the minute.  So thought I would upload another shot from the Roca gallery in London, the others from this location have been in black and white thought it nice to go with a colour one this time round.  I have so many different shots taken here, makes my eyes go funny just looking at them in PS.  This one stood out as I liked the human element within the frame and the shadows and subtle reflections.  

Hope you are all having a good week?
