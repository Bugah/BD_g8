BNSM Cycle 1, London, Episode 9: Sterotypic Models: Bulimic
So last week London got 1st photo, she was super suprised, and now she's going to try and work to stay there as long as possible! Hope this is good enough. :)

In the photo London is angry at why she can't barf out all the food that she has ate. She's also got a toothbrush ready to brush her teeth. Why? Because when she barfs out her food, all the bacteria will get on her teeth and stain them and will cause bad breath. Plus and all the food on the floor is all the food that she has ate. She can't stop the thinking that she is fat, so she constantly keeps on barfing. :(

Also guys, please don't barf because you think you're &quot;fat&quot;, because you're not. :)

Hope you all like and it explains something. :)
