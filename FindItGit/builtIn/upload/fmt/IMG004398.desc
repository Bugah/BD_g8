It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)
Being in “slow summer mode” I decided to avoid boring you with pictures from this cliff over two weeks or so, on this upload you’ll find <b>a lot more in the comments field….</b>  <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=4732207355&amp;size=large" rel="nofollow">Big on black</a>

I believe the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prekestolen" rel="nofollow">Pulpit Rock/Prekestolen</a> qualifies as a “World Class View”.  Besides the spectacular view, the cliff itself is like a square flat-topped block of stone hanging on the steep slopes up from the fjord (see comments field).  There is even a transverse crack as you step onto it, to increase your pulse further.

The main image here is probably my favourite angle, an obvious target for hdr as there are so much light and shadow.  A lot of adjustments in CS4 to get it right, though.  The slightly desaturated tones makes me think of a 50-60’s postcard, and I believe nothing really have changed here since then.

The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1iR2Wi3u5o" rel="nofollow">AC/DC songtitle</a> fits like hand in glove, and the music is more spot on then, say, the 18-minutes long “Close to the Edge” by Yes :-)
