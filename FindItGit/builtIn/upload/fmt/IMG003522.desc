Post Apoc AK47
7th April, 2013

Today is my birthday, It has been exactly a year now since they came. I remember running, running from the monsters that murdered my family. I shall never forget that day. Now I walk alone, hoping that one day I'll find something, something to give me hope, I hope that it just all ends. My only protection in this bitter world is my AK. It used to be my dads, so I hold it close, and never let go. All I have is this gun, some old clothing and a photo of my family. This photo is my most prized possesion, and is always in the pocket near my heart. Why am I still alive? Is it just luck, fate, or maybe it's God, if there is any God in this wilderness....
