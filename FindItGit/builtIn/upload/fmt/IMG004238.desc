The concert hall was built between 1905 and 1908 for the Orfeó Català, a choral society founded in 1891 that was a leading force in the Catalan cultural and political independence movement that came to be known as the Renaixença (Catalan Rebirth).  Between 1982 and 1989, the building underwent extensive restoration, remodeling, and extension and is now a UNESCO world heritage site.

This photo was taken while attending a piano recital by Alexei Volodin, considerably better than my basic piano playing!
