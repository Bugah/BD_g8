Bhumibol Mega Bridge in Widesceen | Bangkok
The <b>Bhumibol Bridge</b> (named after the current King), also known as the Industrial Ring Road Bridge is part of the 13 km long Industrial Ring Road connecting southern Bangkok with Samut Prakan Province. The bridge crosses the Chao Phraya River twice, with two striking cable-stayed spans of lengths of 702 m and 582 m supported by two diamond-shaped pylons 173 m and 164 m high. Where the two spans meet, another road rises to join them at a free-flowing interchange suspended 50 metres above the ground. The bridge opened for traffic on 20 September 2006, before the official opening date of 5 December 2006.
