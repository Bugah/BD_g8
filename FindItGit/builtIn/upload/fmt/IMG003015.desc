Elevator
For a moment we were safe but then the elevator came down with a crashing sound.
We staggered out of the wreckage and were immediately surrounded by harvest drones.
Flower Power took the pulse gun and started blasting them to pieces.
I tried to stop her but it was already too late.
From the distance we heard an eery shriek ... Followed by another one.
Sarge and Flower Power looked at me with fear in their eyes and we all knew it was time to run!
