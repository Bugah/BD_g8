So, farewell then British Summer Time
So, farewell then British Summer Time


So, farewell then
British Summer Time
It was good while you lasted
But the clocks went back
Last night, so
There's 5 months
of GMT, short days 
and dark evenings ahead
Then Spring will return.

Roll on Spring!

(E J Thribb 17.25)
