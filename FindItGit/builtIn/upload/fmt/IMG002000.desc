Atomium Brussels-Stairs and escalators.
The <b>Atomium</b> is a structure which represents a unit cell of an <b>iron crystal</b>. True to its representation, it has nine spheres made of steel (earlier it was made of aluminum) connected by tubes along the twelve edges of the cube. Its stability is ensured by three bipods. 
The Atomium was built for <b>Expo’1958 – the 1958 Brussels World fair in Belgium</b>. It was meant to last just for the Expo (from 17th April to 19th October 1958) but its popularity resulted in it being made permanent. 
It is very impressive since the skyline is not spoiled by other tall structures. Inside, the tubes which connect the spheres contain <b>escalators, staircases and exhibit halls</b>. The top sphere affords an excellent <b>panoramic</b> view of the city. Three of the upper spheres are closed to public for safety reasons – since they lack the requisite vertical support.
The top and central spheres are accessible only by lift. The others spheres can be accessed by the steep escalators and these cannot be accessed by people on wheelchairs. The central sphere has a bar. The kids sphere is meant for sleep overs for children from school. This is not open to the public. 
The Atomium was closed for nearly two years between 2004 and 2006 for renovation. This was when the aluminium sheets were replaced with steel ones. The interiors were also redone.
