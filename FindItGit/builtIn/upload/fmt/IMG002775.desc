Space Needle
Â© All Rights Reserved

I took this shot while waitng to pick up Anna in Downtown Seattle, WA. Editing this picture took some work and was a pain because the sky came out full of noise so I had to black out the sky...it was a mess and could have been done better but I got sick of playing with it.

This was tone-mapped with Photomatix using a single raw file that I converted to bracketed shots. I then detailed it with Topaz. Believe it or not the yellow color of the needle is actually real with some minor saturation.

Thanks for viewing!
