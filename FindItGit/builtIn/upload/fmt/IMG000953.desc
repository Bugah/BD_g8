First time landed myself here at the W.C park coastline though had visited the Hot spot &quot;playground&quot; with my daughter,Jacy n jo my wife here on many occasion ...lol! 
Man...., this is a toughest fight I encounter, the rocking sea surfaces of station boats really hard freezing n need skill man. A combination of different high iso setting is neccesary. The retire sun had Vanish from the horizon more than 20 min ahead already . This scene look  captivating yet not to miss but the high tigh current looks harder to manage at such a condition for my 500d...Motionless Landscape is much easy to handle... But not this
This is a mixture blending of 2 totaly different Angle night shot merging into a artificial  made up night scene . The whole coastline is too clusted n many unwanted object hinder the compo . To make less is to do more in Photoimpact X3  transformation to tweak the best into one single work piece. Most of those wooden boat do carry lots of mysterious bulky junk items on it . They are indeed station too close apart n I decided to clone into this final image .
