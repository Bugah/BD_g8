A customer requested that we design a bullpup semi-auto sniper rifle. So we did just that. We designed the rifle with ergonomics in mind. The ideal cartridge in mind was the .308 Win, for power, availability and speed. One of our designers came back with a futuristic design. We loved it and gave it the ok. Two weeks later a prototype is built and ready for field testing. So we sent another member who loves sniper rifles to do the testing. 100 shots, 3 inch grouping at one mile. With that data the rifle would go into mass production stages. Our customer would get the first order of 20 rifles.
