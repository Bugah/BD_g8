Some of you been asking me how I did this. Well it's quite simple you just need the right timing an the right place.... Basically these daisies were growing halfway in front of an approximately 2 mt. high (about 6,50 feet) wall in my Mother's garden. At that time of year/hour the light were coming diagonally down from the upper side of the wall to the top of the flower creating a strong ray. This situation combined with the fact that I was focusing on the very lighted side of the daisy made the shadowed side between the flower and the wall very very dark almost black! Check out the other pictures from my set <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14279081@N08/sets/72157626954762312/">the floating serie</a>

Thank you all very much for your visits, comments, faves!!!
