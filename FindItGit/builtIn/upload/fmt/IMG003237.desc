Always look on the bright side of life!
&quot;Always look on the light side of life.
If life seems jolly rotten there's something
you've forgotten and
that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
When you're feeling in the dumps
don't be silly chumps
just purse your lips and whistle
that's the thing!&quot;

From my archives - I thought I'd save this for the darkest, coldest, wettest winter day - the time has come!
