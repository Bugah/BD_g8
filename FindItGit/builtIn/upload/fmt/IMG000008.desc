The Tower of London - lightstream
 <b>Â© All rights reserved. </b>
Back to basics then for this one which was taken last night.
Night shot of the famous Tower of London, which is a famous landmark close to Tower Hill. The long exposure allows the bus and car lights to make streams of colour across the foreground. 

Please don't place links to your own images as they will be removed - thanks.
