Air Halo
Went diving on Saturday and was blowing bubbles - Problem is: the camera doesn't have a wide enough angle lens on it to capture the bubble when it's nearest the 'perfect circle' point - which is immediately after exhalation.  Don't think a wide angle adaptor will fit on the end of the camera inside the housing, either... so I think I'll have to work on more perfect bubbles.  which means more diving... ahhhh, sometimes it's a rough life.
