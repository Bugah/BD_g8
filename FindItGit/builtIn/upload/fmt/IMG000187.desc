Taken for friday food fiesta (Green week)

K it was tough deciding what to shoot this week. Green thoughts ran riot thru my mind the whole of this week.
At first I thought I might do a pesto sauce pasta but my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eyes1997/72387662/">dish</a> didnt turn out to be quite green enough. Then I thought I could go look for  green <a href="http://www.bengawansolo.com.sg/products_kuehs.htm">lapis sagu</a> but I didn't find any so I got these instead from Bengawan Solo.
