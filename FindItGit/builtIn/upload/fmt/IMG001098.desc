Deep in Paris
To get a photo like this, you need a wide-angle lens but not necessarily a fish-eye lens. The 14-24 on the Nikon looks like a fisheye because it is so bulbous, but it is not. The fisheye does that extreme warping that can be quite artistic and nice. These wide angles, however, while warping, do not make the final image so abstract as to be almost unrecognizable.
