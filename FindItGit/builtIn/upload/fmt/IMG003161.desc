Spring Trees HDR
I recently went on a trip home to Elgin in Scotland and saw this group of trees which begged to be photographed.  I uploaded a similar shot which was processed in Photoshop alone.  This is the HDR version processed in Photomatix Pro using 3 exposures.  I think it gives a great feeling of springtime.
