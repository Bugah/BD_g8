Seattle From Gasworks
&quot;The Seattle area has been inhabited for at least 4,000 years, but European settlement began only in the mid-19th century. The first permanent white settlers--Arthur A. Denny and those subsequently known as the Denny party--arrived November 13, 1851.&quot;

&quot;Gas Works Park in Seattle, Washington is a 19.1 acre (77,000 mÂ²) public park on the site of the former Seattle Gas Light Company gasification plant, located on the north shore of Lake Union at the south end of the Wallingford neighborhood.&quot;
