Sunlight through the Trees.
This rare MTM tuned Audi RS4 also belonged to the friendly guys in the F430. It has even more power than the Ferrari :) But this was still not the highlight of the dayâ€¦.
I'm very content with the lightning in this shot, but maybe I should have edited it a bit different. What do you think?
