The Garden Center (EXPLORED)
This is day 102

Explored #3

So today, me, Xiang, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreasmoulis/">AJ</a> and Brock went out to shoot for my 365. Since I don't usually have a location picked out ahead of time for my 365 shots, we started driving around for a while and eventually we somehow ended up inside Lowes (for those who don't know, Lowes is a hardware store) hahahah.  Of course, Xiang is absolutely gorgeous and could pull off pretty much anything, anywhere so shooting there was no exception. There were actually a ton of cool opportunities for strong compositions available inside so it was good to challenge myself in the composition department. There is definitely more to come from this series though.
