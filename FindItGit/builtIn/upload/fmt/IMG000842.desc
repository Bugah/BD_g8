[ POSIDON ] OF THE EAST
Before you congratulate me, I did NOT buy a new camera :|
While out at Al-Doha... shooting with a few buddies, one offered me to try out his EOS-1D Mark II Body with the EF 16-35mm f/2.8 L lens (Thanks Yousef)

A great camera and a fine lens. I especially like the ISO 50 feature. The slow sensor sensitivity gives very nice color rendition. 

This one was taken with 1-stop GND + Sunset filter.
1.6secs - f/11 @ ISO 50
