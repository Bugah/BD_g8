Mission Space exterior

One thing we really had going for us during this trip was the dramatic skies. 

This was one of those &quot;run and gun&quot; captures that I made while heading into the ride. If I had the chance to recompose the shot, I probably would have gotten down low to the ground, more over to the right and shot up with a slight tilt. Oh well, next time.
