The Scare @ Homebake
<a href="http://www.thescare.net/">This band</a> from Queensland put on a great live show with a lead singer who comes across as rather unhinged. At one point he was leaning down, screaming into the mic, i was taking photos and he lunged towards me and pretty much tackled me to the ground. Not in an aggressive way, more in a &quot;i wonder what would happen if i did this&quot; sort of way.  After i picked myself up he just lay their continuing to sing from the floor. 

I like a frontman (or woman) who is a little bit crazy, where you never know what they'll do next. Much more entertaining to watch.
