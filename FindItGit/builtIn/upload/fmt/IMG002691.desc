M106 (NGC 4258) LRGB + HA
Note: Original image has been replaced, I was a little excited and over hasty when I first posted the image not realizing until it was later pointed out to me that my image was too light.

I'd like to thank Andy (Buzzer D) and Peter (floppypaws) for their constructive observations.

This is 9 hours of luminance + 11 hours of RGB + 2 hours of HA. Total Exposure 22 hours.
