Sweet Brazilian Jabuticabas...
Hugging this gigantic <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabuticaba" target="_blank">Jabuticaba</a></i> tree, 5-year old Tamiris’ beautiful blue-black eyes are as sweet as the delicious fruits that cover the entire trunk and branches of this remarkable tree when in season. Her three older brothers already participate at Hummingbird's main centre, which is too far away for little Tamiris to come.
 
Tamiris is one of the happy children who may soon be able to participate at our preliminary community prevention centre at the <i>Sítio Joaninha</i>, which we are preparing in an existing building until we receive planning permission for the actual centre that we aim to set-up in this most underprivileged community.

You can follow developments of this project with the youth who are being prepared to work in our new community centres, through the Blog of our Youth Capacity Building Programme, <i><b><a href="http://asasdobeijaflor.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">ASAS do Beija-Flor</a></b></i> or WINGS of Hummingbird.
