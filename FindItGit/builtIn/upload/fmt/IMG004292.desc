#322/365 When I'm not lugging around the D3, I use what I call my &quot;Portable kit&quot;. This consist of my compact d40 and my compact bogen tripod. I'm thinking though the &quot;kit&quot; is still a little too big...maybe a smaller camera? Thanks to Kirk who was help me demo the two for you to see what a great combo they make.
