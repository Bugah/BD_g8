Third of Three <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wunztwice/sets/72157625356187425/with/5213236690/">Vic Vipers</a> for Nnovvember 2010.
Also, per suggestions I did do some Nnenn-style modding, with tape on the windshield/hinge bricks and a cut/sanded 1x1 brick on the end of the gun to mirror the angle of the gun.

Named after General Grant's nickname the Unconditional Surrender was the Union's response to the Confederated Colonies' <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wunztwice/5213236690/">&quot;Grey Ghost.&quot;</a>  Like the Ghost, the U.S. was armed with a weapon designed to pierce the armor on capitol ships.

Fun Fact: I grew up in Grant County, Oregon, named after the Civil War General.  It seemed the logical counterpart to John &quot;Grey Ghost&quot; Mosby.
