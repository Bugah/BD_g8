Odd Couple 2
This isn't the best quality photo, but it's special.  It was taken at night so it was dark and their eyes glowed.  With some help I did the best to improve the quality.
For obvious reasons it's special, but also because they both aren't here anymore.
Brock passed away recently and the little orphan went to a rehabber.  
Having the fawn around was definitely a special experience.  As as you can see in previous photos, she got along well with the dogs and cats :)
