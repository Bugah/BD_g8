St. Paul's Cathedral, Liège, Belgium
Liège Cathedral, otherwise St. Paul's Cathedral, Liège, in Liège, Belgium, is the seat of the Bishopric of Liège. During the French Revolution the ancient cathedral of Liège, St. Lambert's Cathedral, was destroyed systematically, from 1794 onwards. After the revolutionary fervour had evaporated a new cathedral was needed. The ancient collegiate church of St. Paul's was thought suitable for the purpose and was elevated in rank, before 1812. This is the present Liège Cathedral.

It's Saint-Paul's Cathedral that houses today the Treasury of Saint-Lambert's Cathedral. Like most of the religious buildings of this size, Saint Paul's has undergone various refurbishments and reconstructions since it was first built in around 1230 - the last addition was an additional floor in the tower in the 19th century which is an imitation of that of Saint-Lambert. The Treasury in the 15th century cloisters houses many treasures including the famous &quot;Reliquary of Charles the Bold&quot; (around 1467), the famous bust-reliquary of Saint-Lambert (around 1512) and the Meuse ivory of the Three Resurrections.
