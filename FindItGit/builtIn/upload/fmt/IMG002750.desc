Escort Carriers Compilation
Here is a compilation of my 4 entries for the 'Create a Starship' contest for Eve Online. You can view each entry individually in my photostream.

I have chosen to work on a single ship class with a variation for each of the Eve online races. The classe is 'Escort Carrier'. Sub Capitals ships without jump drives. geared towards drones deployment or maybe even fighters and being mostly thought out for fleet support.

Models were designed in sketchup. Rendered in V-Ray and then textured in Photoshop.
