Thanks at the Buddhist Temple
While walking around the city of Melaka on Saturday afternoon, I was getting lost on purpose through the back streets.  I came across a Buddhist sanctuary and temple.  As I came around the outer wall, I found this old guy meditating and begging.  I gave him a few Malaysian Ringits and he said thank you while I took this quick shot.

He didn't speak any English but continued to give thanks and bow to me while sitting calmly.
