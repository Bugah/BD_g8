Old man sitting in the entrance of a swimming pool, Asmara, Eritrea
You can freely enter the swimming pool, and have a drink while teenagers swim and have fun in the art deco place... This old man stood in front of the colored window, just below a giant ferrari flag (remember that Eritrea is a former italian colony)
