Sky & Earth
I noticed a beautiful gradiation in the skyline and rich red earthy color at sunset and pulled over at a rest area, grabbed my camera and tripod, and took this photo.  

And, yes... this is how it looked right out of the camera.  No photoshop or any modifications.  

It's one of my favorites.

Camera settings:
10 second exposure with f/8 and ISO-100
