'Boat, Ma'am?' ..... (EXPLORE#17)
Along Bruges' Canals.....Bruges has a network of picturesque canals running through the heart of the city, and beautiful bridges too, some dating back to over 250 years. Hence it takes the title of  ' Venice of the north '.....A million thanks to all my friends , contacts  &amp;  all flickr members, this is my fifteenth image in Explore. Without your help this would not have been possible. So, thanks to YOU ALL. Thanks.
