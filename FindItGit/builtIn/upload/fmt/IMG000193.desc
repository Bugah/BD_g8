<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/satorarepo/sets/72157628098315550/with/6668040759/">Porto</a> is home to a number of dishes from traditional Portuguese cuisine.

A typical dish from this city is <i>Tripas à Moda do Porto</i> (Tripes Porto style), which still can be found everywhere in the city today.

<i>Bacalhau à Gomes de Sá</i> (Gomes de Sá Bacalhau) is another typical codfish dish born in Porto and popular in Portugal.

The <i><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/satorarepo/6956161603/in/set-72157625898087864">Francesinha</a></i> - literally Frenchy, or more accurately little French (female) - is the most famous popular native snack food in Porto. It is a kind of sandwich with several meats covered with cheese and a special sauce made with beer and other ingredients.

<i>Port wine</i>, an internationally renowned wine, is widely accepted as the city's dessert wine, especially being that the wine is made along the Douro River which runs through the city.
