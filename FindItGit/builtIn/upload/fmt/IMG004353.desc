If you break down, it's a cold hard shoulder.

Cigarettes are disgusting. Bleggghh. 

And my car has broken down twice today. Once at like 1 in the morning, and then again right after I took this shot.

On a better note, I shot this with the 50mm 1.7 lens that I got with my film camera from school, which just <i> happened </i> to fit my camera body. Yeee.
