Seattle Skyline
Ok, so here's the deal... I took this shot a while back and it has just been sitting on my computer, not being of any use. I typically dislike editing photos so that they look unrealistic or surreal. But, here in Washington State, the weather tends to make everything gray- and gray is depressing. So, I had to do something that would change it up. I actually don't know if I like the way it came out... but I can't figure out what I should do with it.

You have to let me know what you think of it. No really, tell me if you like it or just straight up hate it. And then tell me why.

Thank you for every single view, comment, and fav. They are very much appreciated!
