If thou tastest a crust of bread, thou tastest all the stars and all the heavens (Explore!)
~ Robert Browning 

They say -- Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper. 

I feel life is too short to compromise on anything. I say - try everything and eat like a king always! Oh this makes me hungry again! :)

Will see you soon ! :)
