Of the Earth
Historically, buildings have been constructed of wood, stone and earth but, greatly unappreciated, is the importance of the latter.  Earthen architecture is the world's oldest and most widespread building form and even today, 40 to 50% of the world's population live or work in buildings made of the soil.  Of the buildings listed by UNESCO as World Heritage sites, 20% are constructed of earth; some of the finest examples of these are in Djenne and Timbuktu, Mali.

Earth (soil) is a readily available material, is inexpensive and provides good insulation to maintain warmth or coolness, as needed.  It is made into a construction material by merely adding water and perhaps some straw. It's major drawback, however, is that it cannot withstand the elements and basically melts in the rain.  Buildings made of mud therefore require constant maintenance and reconstruction to maintain their structure.  For this reason, few historical examples of earth architecture from before the 18th century remain in the world and most books on architectural history deal only with buildings of wood and stone.
