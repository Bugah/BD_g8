Drone
We stumbled upon a drone attacking some new people.
Sarge was crawling away from the bot. Real tough of him! Wasn't he ex-military?
I could have stopped the drone with the control panel but that would have blown my cover.
And besides it was more fun to see Mr Wong and Flower Power trying to shut down the thing.
Kind of strange for it to be attacking them. What is Theo up to?
