Being Busy {Explored}
Macro Monday: Theme - Being Busy

The rains just stopped and I ventured out to try to find some busy bugs.  I Spotted this ant marching back and forth, from the leaf and back down to the ground. Not sure how he was collecting this liquid. I liked this shot because it looks like he's trying to pick the glob up. 

Happy Macro Monday!
