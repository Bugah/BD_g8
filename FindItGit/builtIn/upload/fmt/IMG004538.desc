I want that one
This one's been the screensaver on my phone for a while now, still makes me smile every time i see it.

Catching up on a few William uploads before i head off for another game of cricket today, we (Freshwater CC) won yesterday and are now in the final of the 'Fred Winter cup' (think its like the ashes but bigger and more prestigious :)
