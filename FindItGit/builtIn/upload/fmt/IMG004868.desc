I got a new friend today. It's Ollie. I must confess, I don't really use twitterrific. I did for a while, but it wasn't for me, but I love their mascot! :D

By the way, if you don't already, <a href="http://twitter.com/JavaJunky" rel="nofollow">follow me on twitter</a>. I'm kind of cool...to some...or a few. ;)
