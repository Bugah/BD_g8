A Weed to Welcome 2006
This image is chosen as my &quot;first photo&quot; of 2006 for flickr today.  I had a rough night last night with a virus and a broken toe to keep me both company and awake late.  But such a joy this morning to go out into my urban backyard and find so much beauty.  Did I ever mention how much I enjoy having this little Point and Shoot Minolta DiMAGE x1?
