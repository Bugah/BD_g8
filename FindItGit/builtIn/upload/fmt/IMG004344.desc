Thingamagoop 2 from Bleep Labs
The <a href="http://bleeplabs.com/thingamagoop2/" rel="nofollow">Thingamagoop 2</a>, an amazing &quot;handmade, analog and digital synthesizer you control with light&quot; from Bleep Labs.  

This is definitely the most bizarre &quot;instrument&quot; I have ever played, and one of the most fun, and I look forward to making some random noise symphonies.

This little robot is very 2012-ish.
