On an 85/1.8.  Previously was desperate to own one (well, the 1.2 version), but now not sure if I can justify it over my 50/1.4.

Kat's grandma liked a square crop of this photo that Kat sent her at the beginning of December, so we've printed off a 10x8 for her for christmas.  Thought I might as well start putting newer stuff on Flickr now.

Kat was trying out the flash in the bottom right of this photo as part of a Canon gear-test day.  Out of context it does look a little distracting, but I guess it ties her to what she was doing.
