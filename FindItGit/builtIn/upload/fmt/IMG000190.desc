The Pier Cafe at Dusk
Yesterday I had a photo view that was referred from google.com with the search term &quot;san diego pier cafe photography flickr justin.&quot;  I hope that person found what they were looking for.  I've been sitting on this one for awhile because I have a couple photos of the Pier cafe in my stream, but I haven't posted anything new for a long time.  There are a few more compositions I want to try, so I'm sure I'll be back here again soon.

The Pier Cafe has got to be the most photogenic building in San Diego.  That's probably a debatable statement, but it's definitely unique and recognizable.
