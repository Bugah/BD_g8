Walt Disney World:  The Place Where Minds Wander
Not quite as catchy of a tagline as &quot;The Place Where Dreams Come True,&quot; is it? 

Well, the title tagline is more apt for me.  While setting up for Wishes on this particular evening, I thought that it would be nice to get some wide angle shots, with distorted (and lit) buildings from Main Street encroaching on the edges of the image. 

The problem with that idea is that the Main Street buildings are not lit for Wishes.  This is something, as someone who has been to Walt Disney World and seen Wishes countless times, I should have known.  I have no idea what happened or why I forgot, but the result was a series of 15mm shots that had to be cropped a good deal.
