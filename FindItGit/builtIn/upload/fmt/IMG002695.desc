LEGO Treebeard
Treebeard from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.

This is based off the Ent frame I made for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/onelug">One LUG</a>'s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/onelug/sets/72157627770924700/">The Last March of the Ents</a> display. I wanted to build a Treebeard but got carried away building other Ents to populate the diorama. So I built him a half year too late and on a three inch round base (instead of a 8 foot round base). I guess it all works out the same.

The eyes are made of a trans-yellow <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=751" rel="nofollow">old school hose/tube</a>.
