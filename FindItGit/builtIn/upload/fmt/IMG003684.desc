SF Fleetweek 2011.
<b> There are 13 images from the show in the comments box below </b>

I have to admit I felt a little silly coming to the show this year with my dinky 200mm lens and half broken D90 camera, while watching dozens of nearby photographers with 600mm lenses on full frame cameras shooting of 8 fps in rapid succession.  I often put down my camera and just watched the proceedings by eye.  I have to say it was a great day for being out.  I love air shows and this one was a winner.

Enjoy the photos below.
