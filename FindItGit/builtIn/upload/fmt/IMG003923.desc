30 Days of Life Support - Pen & Paper: I Love Flickr
<b>(#2/30) Pen &amp; Paper</b>

This is so simple and meaningless to most, but I feel like I <i>need</i> it. I know there's the convenience of typing everything out if I ever needed, but there's something about <i>writing</i> for me, it feels so satisfying at times, I don't even know what it is.

This is a month long project of must haves (life support) on a day to day basis for 30 days. The theme is based around the little things that I &quot;can't&quot; live without or get me through the day, today, yesterday, whichever day.
