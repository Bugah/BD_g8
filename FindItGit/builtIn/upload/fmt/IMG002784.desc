Blue Ray S4
From the day of her retirement from active duty at the Lunar Defence Force about 30 years ago  <strong>Difs Sarkisian</strong> lives in an inoperative hangar of her squad. Flying was and is her passion. No ship ever was fast enough for her.

For quite a time she has been working on a ship with sufficient power and speed. When she heard about <a href="http://www.1000steine.de/1000steine/forum2/forum_entry.php?id=179126" rel="nofollow">Race of Veterans</a> she drumed up her crew immediately. 

Don't get fooled by her <a href="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=4074892" rel="nofollow">appearance</a>. She admits that some parts of her body are nearly 80 years old. It's tremendous what steps anaplasty took since the early 2000. 

After several night shifts the <a href="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=398719" rel="nofollow">Blue Ray S4</a>  is ready for the race. The first flight attempts were very  promising . So it seems to become a quite fast race.

On the picture itself: I used a <a href="http://www.pearl.de/a-PE3413-1123.shtml?query=Fotozelt" rel="nofollow">80x80cm photo tent</a>. Natural daylight from upper, back and right. No stand.
