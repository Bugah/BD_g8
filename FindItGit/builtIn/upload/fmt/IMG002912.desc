Whole Wheat
<i>Golden, ripe wheat in a vast Montana wheat field south of Chinook.</i>

Every time I drive by a vast Montana wheat field I think of the subtle, minimalist photography of Hiroshi Sugimoto. I'm a big fan of his work. And while he focuses mostly on seascapes, it is hard not to imagine the sea when you drive past a Montana wheat field.

When the stiff Montana winds blow, the wheat creates waves in the field just like water would. Combines move across the wheat like large boats on the ocean. The fields here are so large and so far from the shores of a gravel road they often resemble the sea. And yes, the land here is often so flat, you see nothing but a sea of wheat from the place you stand to the horizon over yonder.

It truly is a special place here. While many photographers concentrate on the mountains to the west of me, I find a special peace here on the open plains of north central Montana.
