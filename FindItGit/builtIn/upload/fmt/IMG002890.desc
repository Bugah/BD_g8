Moscow Metro - Take 2: Mayakovskaya
This is Mayakovskaya station on the Moscow Metro. This and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajbrustein/5513916346/">Park Pobedy</a> were the only two stations I was able to wait it out until there were no people in the shot - and believe me, I spent 30min to 1hr per station trying to get the empty shot. Anyway, this was one of my favorites, so glad it worked out.

When out of inspiration - focus on the number of the 365:
