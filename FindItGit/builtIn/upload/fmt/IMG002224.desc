i have no idea.
73/365.

this a 365 shot from a few days ago, that i never uploaded because im pretty sure its some slight rubbish to say the least. i didnt know what to do anymore, and was feeling stressed out by the project so i stuck glitter on my face and curled up with a dead bear. i was slightly creeped out by the fact that this was once a crazy living animal. 

i decided to suck it up though and upload this... darn 365.
