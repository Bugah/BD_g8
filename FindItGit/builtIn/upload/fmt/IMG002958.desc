The Lensbaby Three.
Time for macro after all the huge stuff... 

I'm still unsure about this shot, its been languishing at the end of my photo-stream with comments disabled all forgotten and neglected where i posted a batch for getty submission (so as not to clutter my stream). But then i noticed it was picked by getty and it had 78 views already, so i thought it might be time to give it a day in the sun.

Happy Poppy Bokeh Wednesday!
